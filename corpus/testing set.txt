this fourth edition of the handbook of forensic psychology , like its predecessors , aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of forensic psychology , becoming familiar with the expanding research base in this specialty , and learning to apply forensic concepts artfully in everyday practice . to this end , the contributors to this volume , as in the prior three editions , are accomplished scholars and practitioners in their respective areas . some are prominent academicians who conduct research and offer consultation . others are actively engaged service providers who also make significant contributions to the literature . several have degrees in law as well as psychology . these authors were asked to delineate the enduring issues in an area of their specialty and frame these issues in the light of contemporary research and prevailing conceptual formations . although similar in focus and structure to previous editions , the present volume has been substantially rewritten and updated to enhance its value . the content and sequence of the chapters have been reframed to increase their relevance to the practice of forensic psychology and encompass both recent research findings and developments in statutory and case law . as testimony to the fresh perspectives in this fourth edition , the table of contents identifies forty eight authors and coauthors , of whom twenty four are new contributors to the handbook . the present volume comprises six parts . part one concerns the context of forensic psychology and begins with chapters on the history of forensic psychology and on defining the nature of forensic psychology . chapter three then provides information about and guidelines for accessing the legal literature . chapter four alerts forensic psychologists to ethical and legal considerations that should guide their work , with specific attention to the american psychological association ethics code and the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology . chapter seven discusses personal injury litigation , with particular attention to considerations in psychological assessment . chapter eight reviews the impact of recent congressional legislation on identifying and treating educational disabilities . chapter nine examines issues related to the assessment of persons competence to execute a variety of legal rights in civil contexts . chapter ten concludes this section with guidelines for conducting evaluations in cases of alleged child abuse or neglect . part three deals with applying psychology in criminal proceedings and covers three critical considerations of concern to triers of fact . chapter eleven provides guidelines for assessing competence to stand trial . correctional psychology , for example , presupposes some understanding of criminal psychology . assessment , which we cover under legal psychology , is an essential tool of the trade for psychologists , and it underlies all practice . nonetheless , for purposes of identifying historical trends and landmarks , discussion of these four distinctive areas is warranted . we focus on forensic psychology rather than forensic psychiatry , which has its own well documented and rich history , probably centered on the early work of isaac ray , who is considered by some the father of forensic psychiatry . we also do not delve into the origins of the sociology of law , referred to as sociological jurisprudence , or the legal realism movement within the law itself . this movement , born during the first third of the twentieth century , advocated a partnership between the law and the social sciences . in addition , we emphasize the work of forensic psychologists in the united states and , to a lesser extent , oneanada , although we give due recognition to the work of european psychologists , who dominated the field prior to world war i . the field prior to world war one . we review the achievements of psychologists from the end of the nineteenth century and extend our discussion into the nineteen seventies , when forensic psychology came of age . the reader interested in more detail about the issues and individuals discussed might check landmark summaries of psychology and law published by whipple , hutchins and slesinger , louisell , tapp , loh and monahan and loftus . more recently , brigham and grisso and mulberger have published historical pieces on this topic , the latter with a strong emphasis on german influences . it focuses on psycholegal research and contacts with judges , lawyers , and other law related professionals in a wide range of contexts . the origins of legal psychology can be traced to the work of experimental psychologists in europe in the nineteenth century , particularly in relation to the psychology of testimony and most particularly to the testimony of children , whose memory of events was considered unreliable . we discuss this work shortly . do chestnut or oak trees lose their leaves earlier in autumn ? his subjects were allowed thirty seconds to consider their answers , then told to write their responses and indicate their degree of confidence in each answer . when cattell conducted his informal and preliminary study , it was reasonably well established that eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable and incomplete . most significant for the historical development of forensic psychology was the apparent fascination cattell experiment and binet work held for william stern , who had received his doctorate in psychology at the university of berlin under the tutelage of hermann ebbinghaus . in nineteen one , stern collaborated with the criminologist liszt in an attempt to lend realism to the cattell design . although the witnesses were law students who , stern asserted , should have known the pitfalls of testifying , none could give a faultless report . the number of errors per individual ranged from four to twelve . courtroom testimony . pinpointing the origins of courtroom testimony by psychologists in europe is not easy . sources differ , often depending on the nature of the forum or its context . hale suggests that the earliest testimony by a psychologist in a criminal court occurred in eighteen ninety six , when albert von schrencknotzing testified at the trial of a munich man accused of murdering three women . the murders had received extensive and sensational press coverage in the months prior to the trial , and schrencknotzing opined that this pretrial publicity , through a process of suggestion , probably led numerous witnesses to retroactive memoryfalsification . witnesses could not distinguish between what they had seen and what the press reported had happened . schrencknotzing supported this opinion with social framework testimony in the form of accounts of laboratory research on memory and suggestibility . although the accused was convicted on the basis of solid evidence , schrencknotzing direct application of the psychology of suggestion to court processes helped stimulate the interest of both german jurists and psychologists . however , karl marbe , a psychology professor at the university of wurzburg , credited himself with the first court appearance , fifteen years later . the first german psychological legal expert opinion was my testimony in a case of sexual assault in wurzburg in nineteen eleven , in which i had to discuss the question of the testimony of children . in that case , several german adolescent girls had accused their teacher of sexually molesting them . marbe persuaded the jury that the girls statements were unreliable , and the teacher was exonerated . also in nineteen eleven , several psychologists testified in a belgian murder trial in which a man was accused of raping and killing a nineyearold girl . two of the child playmates had apparently seen the murderer but gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts . he found that they were inaccurate in their recall of important events . over the objection of the prosecution , he was allowed to present the results of these experiments as well as the general research on the psychology of testimony that was available at that time . whipple wrote that varendonck testimony elicited violent outbursts from the court authorities , but it reached the jury and induced a verdict of not guilty , whipple added that the psychology of testimony had found its way formally into the court room and saved a man life . the jury found the defendant not guilty . varendonck , it should be noted , was vehemently opposed to any use of child witnesses in the courtroom . marbe was asked to testify as to the probable effect of alcohol both on the mental status of the engineer and the reaction time of the fireman and guard applying the brakes . based on reaction time experiments , marbe testified that the train could not have been stopped in time to avert a disaster . in essence , it is not difficult to find illustrations of psychologists who had impact on the nascent field of legal psychology , but ranking their contributions chronologically must be done with caution . european psychologists at the turn of the twentieth century and until world war one also were delving into the area of guilt deception , european psychologists at the turn of the twentieth century and until world war one also were delving into the area of guilt deception , the precursor of the lie detection of today . in nineteen four , psychologists in germany , austria , and switzerland were busy developing a lie detection test for use in criminal investigations . the test was a word association time task in which key words were embedded in a list of innocuous words , the test was a word reaction time task in which key words were embedded in a list of innocuous words . one of wundt not so cautious students was the german psychologist hugo munsterberg , who arrived in the united states in eighteen ninety two at the invitation of william james to direct the psychology laboratory at harvard university . now acknowledged by many as the father of applied psychology , he believed psychological knowledge could be applied to education , industry , advertising , music , art , and , of course , law . not surprisingly , the legal community vehemently resisted his intrusion into its territory , and there was much ado about this . charles c . moore , a wellknown attorney , referred to munsterberg work as yellow psychology and concluded that it provided nothing new or helpful to the court . most noteworthy , the great legal commentator john henry wigmore found it necessary to assail munsterberg in a satirical and devastating law review article . wigmore attack was prompted by the publication of munsterberg controversial bestseller on the witness stand , in which he proclaimed that the time was ripe to apply psychology to the practical needs of the legal system . the book which was essentially a compilation of already published columns dealt with a wide spectrum of topics , ranging from witness accuracy and jury persuasion to hypnosis and lie detection . in similar fashion , bornstein and penrod sought to resurrect the longignored work of george frederick arnold , a civil servant in the british empire who published psychology applied to legal evidence and other constructions of law in nineteen six , two years before munsterberg on the witness stand . munsterberg has been accused of being more an opportunist than a trailblazer , however . it is tempting to blame his brashness , his apparently despicable demeanor , and his progerman views for the tenuous and occasionally hostile initial relationship between psychology and law . he received a law degree in nineteen eighteen and a phd in psychology in nineteen twenty one , both from harvard . marston interests were multifaceted . although admitted to the massachusetts bar , marston soon gave up his law practice to concentrate on psychology . as a laboratory assistant in psychology at radcliffe college , marston had discovered a significant positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and lying , which became the basis of the modern polygraph . however , this interest was almost exclusively on the part of lawyers , who produced such books as legal psychology , psychology for the lawyer , and law and the social sciences . wigmore , the foremost authority on rules of evidence , paved the way for the use of test data in the courtroom . he observed that the psychometrist introducing test evidence would stand on the same footing as the expert witness to insanity , as long as such tests are recognized as valid and feasible by the general scientific community . as louisell noted , however , because trial court records are generally unavailable and only appellate decisions are published , the testimony of psychologists , particularly in civil cases , may have been less rare than the paucity of documentation would indicate . we do know that psychological testimony was almost inevitably rejected in criminal cases involving the defendant mental state . as a general rule , only medical men that is , persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine can testify as experts on the question of insanity ; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion . the first published case in which an american psychologist qualified as an expert appears to be state driver in nineteen twenty one . the occasion was only a partial victory for forensic psychology , however . a west virginia trial court accepted the chief psychologist of the state bureau of juvenile research as an expert on the matter of juvenile delinquency . the work of henry goddard during this time must in hindsight be regarded with embarrassment . interviews each prisoner to determine background , attitudes , and personality traits for use in guidance , education , possibilities for parole , and placement . results of interview are written and may be submitted in form of case study with test results or other reports . makes recommendations for parole and supplies technical information at staff meetings . perhaps even more relevant was the suspicion directed toward psychologists by both administrative and correctional staffs . in an essay reviewing this period in the history of correctional psychology , brodsky cited examples of military psychologists being given punitive assignments or civilian psychologists being obstructed from providing meaningful treatment services to inmates in some cases even reporting for work to find themselves no longer employed , their possessions waiting for them at the prison gate . although positions were plentiful , the turnover rate was high , primarily because psychologists often had not received adequate preparation for responding to the unique challenges of these environments . one noteworthy innovation that was introduced in federal prisons during this era was the unit management system , which was initially conceptualized by daniel glaser and later promoted by robert levinson . unit management divided prison populations into small groups of prisoners and staff members based on the programming needs of the former and the expertise of the latter . a contemporary of terman , psychologist louis thurstone , was also interested in the value of intellectual testing in police screening . thurstone administered the newly developed army intelligence examination to three hundred and fifty eight male members of the detroit police department . the army alpha , developed by robert yerkes , thorndike , and lewis terman and adopted by the us army in nineteen seventeen, was probably the first exclusively american test of intelligence . in the years between the two world wars , psychologists gradually became more involved in the screening of law enforcement personnel and began to incorporate personality assessment into that enterprise . in recent years , other board certifications have emerged , such as the american board of forensic examiners . in two thousand and one , as noted earlier , the apa voted to recognize forensic psychology as a specialty , and specialty guidelines for forensic psychologists and psychology were adopted in nineteen ninety one and two thousand and eleven , respectively . forensic psychology has seen a rapid expansion in other parts of the globe besides north america , particularly in europe and australia . after an uncertain beginning and some stagnation between the two world wars , forensic psychology is now well established . despite some continuing concerns about its definition , it is importantly clinical in nature but also critically dependent on theory and research . indeed , brigham reported that disagreement among members of apls about how broad or narrow the definition should be initially led the group to abandon a cooperative effort with the american academy of forensic psychology to jointly sponsor a petition to have apa formally recognize forensic psychology as a specialty . in countries that use the term forensic psychology in an expansive way , those who work in the applied areas of psychology and the law typically are referred to as clinical forensic psychologists . regardless of the differences that exist concerning the definition of forensic psychology , it is uniformly agreed that forensic psychology involves the application of psychological knowledge and expertise to the legal system . law relies on the adversarial method , whereas psychology relies on the experimental method . the law seeks justice , which equates to procedural fairness . it is hoped that just procedures will assist in arriving at the truth ; however , knowing that the truth is elusive , it is seen as more important to ensure that the principles of due process are followed . to arrive at the truth in law , conflicting points of view are presented within the strict parameters of a trial or appellate hearing , with each side putting its best case forward . law is idiographic , whereas psychology is nomothetic . law operates on a case by case basis , with each case decided on the basis of its specific facts . in contrast , psychology is interested in uncovering the general principles , relationships , and patterns that govern human behavior . the focus in psychology is not on a particular instance but rather on what transcends the particular instance . law is reactive , whereas psychology is proactive . the issues that arise in the law originate from outside the system , namely , cases are brought to the attention of lawyers . in contrast , psychologists , notwithstanding the presence of various external pressures , have considerable control over the issues they study . law is operational , whereas psychology is academic . law is an applied discipline , and it is designed to deal with real world problems . the players within the system have clearly defined roles that prescribe the issues on which they will concentrate . in contrast , similar to the distinction noted previously , psychologists have considerable say over the issues they pursue . the driving force tends to be more of a quest for knowledge for its own sake . with these eight tensions in mind , included in what follows is an expansive survey of what can be characterized as forensic psychology . psychologists involvement in these matters is predicated on the assumption that their observations and opinions will educate the recipient about some psychological phenomena that are relevant to the legal matters in dispute , and , as a result , a more accurate and presumably better decision will be made . conducting and testifying about forensic psychological evaluations . most frequently , psychologists provide assistance to the legal system by offering observations and opinions about the emotional , behavioral , and cognitive functioning of someone whose mental state is at issue in a legal proceeding . because a defendant , litigant , or other person emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning can be at issue in a variety of legal proceedings , psychologists find themselves evaluating and testifying about the functioning of persons in many different legal matters . in criminal proceedings , psychologists may evaluate defendants when there are questions about their competence to proceed , criminal responsibility , and treatment needs for consideration at the time of sentencing . in civil proceedings , psychologists can evaluate litigants and others when there are questions about their capacity to parent , manage their personal and financial affairs , execute a will , work , or make healthcare decisions , or when there are disputes about their emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning as it relates to their risk for harming themselves or others or an alleged wrong committed by a third party . in these cases , such as recent legal disputes regarding the apple and samsung wireless phones , one company alleges that another is unfairly encroaching on a unique aspect of its product that results in consumer confusion and harms the company economically . in zippo manufacturing rogers imports , the zippo lighter company argued that a competitor rogers imports copied the design of its cigarette lighter in such a way that it violated its trademark , caused consumers to confuse the two brands , and resulted in decreased zippo sales and income . psychologists can also assist legal decision makers and legislative bodies by providing observations and expert opinions about more general matters that are nonetheless of interest to the court or legislature . walker and monahan referred to this as social authority testimony . in litigation contexts , psychologists typically testify about research that sheds light on some matter or an assumption that is relevant to the case at hand , but they typically do not offer opinions about specific case matters . thus , a psychologist knowledgeable about limitations in how adolescents understand and exercise their constitutional rights while in custody might testify before a legislative body that is considering a law mandating that minors be appointed counsel in delinquency proceedings , whereas a psychologist knowledgeable about the relationship between watching violence on television and aggressive behavior of children might offer expert testimony to a body considering legislation limiting what is broadcast on television during daytime hours . finally , in a very different line of research , kovera and her colleagues examined the impact of expert testimony on the legal decision making of judges and jurors . as the information just presented demonstrates , the roles of forensic psychologists in these contexts can be broad and varied . at a micro level , their work can involve conducting and reporting the results of psychological assessments or conducting case specific research , both with the intent of providing case relevant knowledge to the legal decision maker that it would not otherwise have , so that more informed and better decisions are made . at the other end of the spectrum the macro level psychologists can help policy makers , legislators , and decision makers better understand the need for or potential impact of proposed legislation or the legal system and its operation . when empaneling a jury , attorneys may rely on forensic psychologists to assist them in selecting the most desirable jurors and deselecting the least desirable jurors . typically , psychologists survey members of the community about matters pertaining to a case in order to identify those characteristics that relate attitudes about the case and case outcomes . consultants may also use focus groups to obtain additional information about the views of people regarding matters at issue in the particular case and how prospective jurors may respond to different arguments . research shows that , without assistance , attorneys may not be very skilled at identifying jurors who might be biased against their clients . although the empirical evidence shows an increased likelihood that jurors will find in favor of the side that employs jury consultants , the results vary across studies and in actual cases particularly since both sides may use consultants . in addition to the strategies just outlined , psychologists who work as jury consultants sometimes employ mock or shadow juries . parent coordination . over the past fifteen to twenty years , psychologists and other mental health professionals have taken on a new role in family court proceedings of parent coordinator or special master . according to the apa , parent coordination is a nonadversarial dispute resolution process that is court ordered or agreed on by divorced and separated parents who have an ongoing pattern of high conflict and litigation about their children . the goal of these evaluations is to facilitate better informed legal decision making by a court or to assist attorneys in their representation of a client . in contrast to general clinical assessments in which the referral question is necessarily clinical in nature , the referral question in fmhas is guided by a specific legal issue defined by a law within the jurisdiction in which the assessment occurs . moreover , a large portion of the questions on the written examination for board certification in forensic psychology by the american board of forensic psychology assess clinicians knowledge of laws , precedents , court rules , civil procedures , criminal procedures , and judicial practices . similarly , board certification for forensic psychiatrists includes , among other requirements , passing an examination that focuses on criminal law , civil law , legal regulation of psychiatry , and other legal topics . in this chapter , we present an overview of conducting legal research , with a specific eye toward mental health professionals who do not have any formal legal training . we begin by discussing the importance of understanding the law , particularly for those mental health professionals who conduct fmhas . because law is established through multiple sources in the united states , acquiring legal knowledge can be a complicated , tedious , and admittedly intimidating process . fortunately , finding and understanding the law may be accomplished in a variety of formal and informal ways . in addition to examining primary and secondary sources of law such as case law , statutes , administrative codes , and a variety of legally relevant publications it is possible to gain proficiency with legal issues through discussions with attorneys and consultation with colleagues and by staying abreast of the relevant behavioral science literature . from that law flows the questions that will be addressed by the mental health expert . however , because legal definitions are not tantamount to psychological concepts , an important element in conducting an fmha entails translating legal language about functional capacities and behavior into relevant measurable constructs . for example , no equivalent solitary constructs exist in the mental health sciences for legal terms such as knowing , intelligent , and voluntary . experts conducting fmhas must therefore operationalize these legal concepts in a way that permits them to be meaningfully measured .  however , in the majority of forensic evaluation contexts , no brightline rule applies , and the evaluator must devise a more complex methodology that incorporates relevant legal questions , an examination of the evaluee underlying psychopathology , and an assessment of the evaluee relevant functional legal capacities . a forensic mental health professional who knows relevant laws and who can identify the forensic issues is in a good position to focus an fmha on specific content domains . for example , by specifying the forensic issues and relevant functional abilities , a forensic mental health professional can narrow the scope of an evaluation by asking questions and administering tests that yield data directly relevant to the legal issue . clinical assessment instruments that address constructs relevant to criminal and civil cases may also be used in the evaluation . the forensic mental health professional must also strive to ensure that his or her testimony will likely be deemed admissible in court under applicable evidentiary standards . the frye general acceptance standard states that for scientific evidence to be admissible in court , the procedure from which the evidence is deduced must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance within the relevant scientific community ; of note , it is the procedures used to obtain the scientific evidence , not the evidence itself , that must be generally accepted . with respect to forming opinions , some jurisdictions prohibit testimony on the ultimate legal issue , reserving this role exclusively for the legal decision maker . for example , although testimony on the ultimate legal issue is permitted under the fre , expert witnesses in federal criminal trials are not permitted to state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or an element of a defense to the crime . because jurisdictional rules regarding ultimate issue testimony may differ , it is crucial that forensic mental health professionals are well versed in the laws of the jurisdiction so they avoid overstepping their boundaries . as previously described , some degree of legal knowledge is a necessary precursor to devising and conducting a highquality fmha . lacking a sufficient understanding of pertinent laws may preclude a forensic clinician from identifying the relevant forensic issues and functional legal capacities in a particular case . clinicians who do not possess adequate legal knowledge may present findings that are irrelevant to the legal question . some scholars have argued that providing ultimate issue testimony is not problematic because many judges and attorneys request forensic clinicians opinions on the ultimate legal question , whereas others counsel against answering the ultimate legal question because it represents an inappropriate intrusion into the domain of the legal fact finder . these scholars argue that because an opinion on an ultimate legal issue can not be rendered without consideration of morals and values , experts conducting fmhas should not stray from their role in offering psychological testimony and opinions related to clinical condition , functional legal capacities , and the relation between the two . for this and other reasons , looking up the law sometimes can be a surprisingly convoluted process . it is not uncommon for novice researchers or those without formal legal training to struggle when first conducting legal research . fortunately , as any first year law student would likely attest , there is a profound learning curve when it comes to conducting legal research . as with the overarching governmental structures , a separation of powers also exists among the three branches of the government . put simply , the legislative branch creates statutes , the judicial branch interprets those statutes via case law , and the executive branch creates administrative agencies that carry out the law and enact regulations . the law created by the executive branch , which is often in the form of an executive order issued by the president or a state governor , is of limited utility to forensic mental health professionals , so here we focus primarily on statutes , case law , and constitutional law . case law . after a statute is enacted , the courts are responsible for interpreting and applying that statutory law in the context of specific disputes , which means that courts are also a source of law . in the process of applying the law , the courts determine where and when the statute applies , whether there are any exceptions to its application , and how vague statutory language should be interpreted . if a court goes so far as to declare a statute invalid , then the statute must be revised by the legislature before it can legally be applied . assuming , however , that the statute is not invalidated , courts will apply the statute in the context of legal disputes . in that sense , constitutions largely protect individuals by limiting governmental power . many state constitutions closely parallel the us constitution , but that pattern is more convention or convenience than requirement . thus , secondary sources may include books purchased at a local bookstore , internet articles or forums discussing a topic of law , or even video or audio recordings . speaking more narrowly , though , there are a few specific secondary legal sources to which legal researchers often turn . legal dictionaries provide the meaning and typical use of legal terms and phrases . an individual who must investigate an unfamiliar area of law might begin with a secondary source to get a broad overview of the law , which will provide insight as to how he or she should go about researching primary source material . someone who feels confident in his or her primary source research may turn later to secondary sources of law as a final step to ensure that nothing has been overlooked . of course , there is no reason why the two sources of law can not be used simultaneously . having reviewed primary and secondary sources of law , an important note is worth highlighting for the forensic mental health professional . because a crime is viewed as an offense against society , the state or federal prosecutor is responsible for bringing charges against a defendant , and he or she reserves the right to drop or amend those charges ; there are no private prosecutions in the united states . as civil matters arise between two parties , it is the responsibility of those parties to mount both the offense and the defense . however , if the murder victim was a federal employee for example , a postal worker or undercover federal bureau of investigation agent then that murder would be tried in federal court . in addition to the victim , the location of the crime can also play a role in determining jurisdiction . typically , cases remain on one side of the rail or the other , but there are instances in which they may jump over the rail from one system to the other . in the state court system , the first level of courts contains the trial courts of limited jurisdiction . these courts , whose names differ among jurisdictions , handle relatively minor judicial matters , such as parking tickets , vandalism , and accrued fines . also on the first level are the trial courts of general jurisdiction . rather , an appellate court , having granted an appeal , will examine and address whether the trial court correctly applied the law in arriving at a verdict and penalty . in this sense , appellate courts are said to resolve issues of law , not issues of fact . at the highest step in the state court system , each state has its high court , which most states call the state supreme court . the state supreme court is also an appellate court inasmuch as it only hears cases for which it has granted an appeal . for example , in new jersey , the trial court is the superior court , the intermediate appellate court is the superior court appellate division , and the high court is the new jersey supreme court . in pennsylvania , the trial court is the court of common pleas , the intermediate appellate court is the superior court , and the high court is the pennsylvania supreme court . perhaps most confusing , in new york , the trial courts are the state supreme courts , the intermediate appellate courts are the appellate courts , and the high court is the new york court of appeals . the federal court system also arranges courts in hierarchical fashion . at the first step , the lowest federal courts are the district courts , which function much like state trial courts . each circuit court has jurisdiction over a specified number of the ninety four district courts . for example , the united states court of appeals for the third circuit has appellate jurisdiction over all of the district courts in delaware , new jersey , pennsylvania , and the us virgin islands . as mentioned earlier , a criminal case that has made or is making its way up the steps of the state court system can potentially jump over to the federal court system ; the reverse situation that is , going from federal court to state court is not permissible in the american legal system . one common method of jumping from state court to federal court is through a writ of habeas corpus , which is an appeal to a federal district court to hear the case at hand . habeas corpus , roughly translated as you have the body , is technically a challenge to the legitimacy of a prisoner detainment . thus , the typical habeas petitioner is a prisoner who has been convicted of a crime . in practice , habeas corpus is an assertion that a prisoner federal constitutional rights were violated along the way toward his or her current detainment . in practice , when a judge faces an issue that has previously been addressed by a court , stare decisis dictates that the judge follow the previous court decision . that said , the judge is not strictly required to follow the previous court decision ; it is just an expectation . but the weight of that expectation can vary depending on which court previously addressed the issue at hand . in that context , how other courts have resolved a legal issue is viewed merely as persuasive authority ; the deciding court is not bound by those decisions , but it may be guided by those other decisions . one final caveat relates to the nature of binding authority and the interplay between federal courts and state courts . state courts are free to adopt the supreme court position , but they are not required to do so . a variety of options are available for those interested in researching the law , and selecting from among the multitude of available resources and various approaches to conducting legal research certainly can be challenging for a mental health professional . westlaw and lexisnexis offer most of the same services , so choosing between the two is often a matter of personal preference , although the different subscription plans are also likely a factor . westlaw provides comprehensive coverage of state and federal case law , state and federal statutes , administrative regulations , and secondary legal resources . another notable feature of westlaw is keycite , which is a citation checking service that allows users to determine whether cases and statutes are still good law . both companies offer a variety of subscription plans tailored to consumer needs ; for example , a small law firm that restricts its business to one state does not have the same needs for electronic legal databases as a large law firm that has offices in several states or even several countries . some of the available pricing plans are flat rate , which means that users have unlimited access to the service for a set time , while other pricing plans are based on the number of transactions conducted . the range for these pricing plans is quite large . a more recent contribution to the forensic literature is the multivolume best practices for forensic mental health assessments series published by oxford university press . at this point , we hope we have made clear the importance of knowing the law , the structure of the law , and how to find the law . after finding the law , the next step is knowing what to do with it , which is often not as straightforward as it might appear . reading and interpreting exactly what is being said by a court or legislature in a case or statute can be challenging . however , as with other topics discussed in this chapter , there is a steep learning curve , enhanced by knowing a few tips and tricks about how to digest legal literature . the topic is large enough to fill an entire chapter or book by itself and has done so many times over . that level of detail can not be matched in this brief section , but we can offer a few tips and guidelines . statutes typically are organized in hierarchical fashion . thus , someone interested in a particular statute may have to look at the criminal code , divided into articles , each of which has chapters , with subsections , and so forth . although harmless while reading a novel , misinterpreting a legal term can alter the statute meaning . it might be a good idea to have a copy of a legal dictionary handy while reading the statute , just in case such a situation arises . last , it is common for statutes to reference other statutes , and only by reading those other statutes is it possible to get a full picture of the statute at hand . unlike statutes , cases do not fit so neatly into a hierarchical format . whereas statutes typically are published or revised holistically , such that everything fits together nicely , precedential cases are decided only as novel legal issues come before a court . after all , if someone is trying to convince the court to adopt a certain line of reasoning , understanding how the court in a cited case applied its own legal reasoning is a necessary precursor.an important step in doing legal research is determining if the law is good law. an authority that is good law carries legal weight and can be safely relied on . as part of this subscription , the publisher sends out updates at regular intervals , usually either quarterly or annually . these updates come printed in a small booklet , cut to fit the size of the legal code , and the booklets conveniently fit within the back of the originally printed hardback code . hence , the pocket part of the statute is located in the back of the book , and it includes all of the updates since the code was last bound . pocket parts should also include citations to any cases that have interpreted the statute . in this last regard , unethical conduct , whether intended or not , can result in serious consequences for professional practitioners . even without violating criminal law , which could lead to being fined or jailed by court order , misbehavior that comes to the attention of an ethics committee or state board of psychology can provoke letters of reprimand , dismissal from membership in professional societies , and suspension or revocation of a license to practice . a recurring and sometimes problematic demand in forensic practice involves psychological testing protocols that are subpoenaed and deemed discoverable by the court . this document , commonly referred to as the ethics code , pertains broadly to psychological practice , teaching , and research but also has numerous implications for forensic practice . the ethics code comprises five general principles and ten specific standards . the general principles are considered aspirational in nature and are intended to guide and inspire psychologists toward the very highest ethical ideals of the profession . the specific standards translate these aspirations into mandatory and enforceable rules of conduct that psychologists are obliged to follow . the chapter then considers some aspects of personal values and professional responsibility that forensic psychologists need to keep in mind , and it concludes with a summary of recommendations for minimizing vulnerability to ethical complaints and legal actions in forensic practice . the section on general principles in the apa ethics code delineates five aspirational goals toward which psychologists should strive in their practice , teaching , and research . beneficence and malfeasance . the first standard in the ethics code provides instructions for resolving conflicts between ethical considerations and the expectations or demands of legal , governmental , or organizational entities . a key provision in the two thousand and two ethics code concerning such expectations and demands was amended in two thousand and ten . this provision had specified that , when faced with ethical conflicts that could not be resolved , psychologists may adhere to the requirements of the law . a psychologist was asked by the attorney representing a father in a child custody dispute to review a report summarizing an evaluation of him that was prepared by a psychologist retained by the mother attorney . the reviewing psychologist was initially impressed with the quality of the examining psychologist report , which included sufficient language to justify casting numerous aspersions on the quality of this father character . on closer inspection , however , the reviewer became concerned by how much of the examiner language appeared to be taken directly from a computer generated test report . nevertheless , before reporting his discovery to the attorney who had retained him and appearing on the witness stand , should the reviewing psychologist have informed the examining psychologist about finding the missing not in his report ? this consultation would have given the examining psychologist an opportunity , prior to being confronted in the courtroom , to apologize for an unintended oversight or to prepare some defense of his actions . he was then able to describe to the lawyer the procedures he would follow in the analysis and to indicate that he had expert consultation available to assist him as needed . on this basis , having initially been candid about his capabilities and then taken steps to become adequately prepared for his task , he was able to provide a helpful analysis of the readability level in the insurance policies . the competence standard also bears directly on forensic psychology in requiring practitioners to establish firm ties between their practices and the scientific bases for these practices . when told only that there is a seventy percent chance of rain , we must make a yes or no decision whether to take an umbrella , and forensic psychologists are regularly asked for similarly discrete opinions in the absence of one hundred percent conclusive evidence one way or the other . ordinarily the most principled course of action in such instances is offering a reasonable estimate , as in reporting a slight , moderate , or considerable chance of reoffending by a person being considered for probation or parole and letting the court or administrative body address the dichotomous decision that is properly its to make . a forensic practitioner who is expert in conducting competency and insanity evaluations in criminal cases may not be familiar with the literature , techniques , and considerations relevant to a fitness for duty evaluation , such as confidentiality issues specific to the workplace and prediction questions central to personnel evaluations . likewise , a psychologist with expertise in criminal cases may not know enough about the technicalities of probate and estate management to provide useful psychological consultation in a civil case involving alleged malfeasance by an estate administrator or executor . as another potential solution to instances of incompetent expert testimony , shuman and greenberg commented that many such problems could be resolved from the bench if judges would take professional ethics codes more seriously than they apparently do . the psychologist offered this testimony despite the existence of a letter found in the purse of the defendant exwife outlining the steps she was to take in helping him construct a convincing insanity defense . could the defendant have been legally insane at the time of the stabbings but subsequently been able to become involved in the planning of his defense ? some questions about the competence of the two expert witnesses in this case come quickly to mind . were they familiar with the applicable legal criteria for insanity ? in the insanity case just discussed , the two experts could have drawn on definite and well established criteria to guide their evaluation of the defendant , these being the two prongs of insanity as defined in statutory law . the first of these prongs , which is universally applicable in us jurisdictions , invokes a cognitive incapacity that prevented the accused from recognizing the criminality of his or her actions at the time of the alleged offense or that prevented the defendant from appreciating the legal or moral wrongfulness of this conduct . these levels of certainty should cover a broad range of possibilities that can be expressed in such terms as reasonably certain , strongly suggestive , some indications but not compelling , and the available data do not warrant an expert opinion on this matter . the level of certainty chosen should be based on the state of knowledge in the areas , the degree to which the particular case touches on definite provisions in the law , and the amount and clarity of available information pertaining to the legal considerations in the case . the fact that such a determination is difficult , however , does not mean that it can not be made . indeed , prediction of future criminal conduct is an essential element in many of the decisions rendered throughout our criminal justice system . what is essential is that the jury have before it all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine . as an important aspect of protecting the wellbeing of persons they evaluate in forensic cases , psychologists should take care to prevent their findings from becoming available to persons who should not receive and do not need to have this information . the key questions for forensic psychologists in this regard concern the kinds of information they should release , in what form this information should be released , to whom the information should be released , and the circumstances under which information should be released . the answers to these questions vary , as prescribed by the applicable regulations in a state . the overarching consideration established by the ethics code is that psychologists should release information only to an individual or entity identified in a written consent form signed by the person evaluated , except when the law requires or permits proceeding otherwise . records indicated that the employer had previously received complaints about the repairman conduct when he was doing clerical work in their central office . as their solution to his being intolerably obnoxious in the central office , the company assigned him to go to people homes by himself , without supervision , and service their malfunctioning appliances . the consulting psychologist found evidence of substantial psychological dysfunction in the plaintiff , probably attributable to the sexual assault , and also some additional psychic harm apparently resulting from harsh depositions conducted by the company attorneys . standard five in the ethics code indicates that psychologists are free to make public statements about their professional qualifications and to express their professional opinions on matters related to psychology . in so doing , however , they must avoid making any false or deceptive statements . although they can advertise their credentials and availability as service providers , they must not hire media personnel to provide publicity for them , nor should they solicit public testimonials about their skills from former therapy patients . among these are being accurate and avoiding deception in the presentation of opinions ; providing appropriate disclosure of sources of information and the bases of these opinions ; and being careful to differentiate among observations , inferences , and conclusions . the specialty guidelines also caution forensic practitioners to be fair , impartial , and respectful should they have occasion to comment on or criticize the conduct of other professionals or participants in a legal proceeding . with respect to fees , this section of the ethics code includes several restrictive provisions with which forensic practitioners must be sure to comply . psychologists must not withhold records for nonpayment of services when these records are needed for emergency treatment of an individual who has been evaluated ; they must refrain from bartering agreements in which goods or services are accepted as payment for fees , unless such nonmonetary remuneration is not clinically contraindicated and is not in any way exploitative ; and they must not kick back to referral sources any portion of fees to which they are entitled on the basis of services they have provided . the forensic specialty guidelines add to these restrictions a caution against contingency fees , which is an especially important consideration in personal injury litigations that could involve substantial settlements . these goals and the nature of the program should be described clearly and accurately to all interested parties . teachers and supervisors must provide accurate information to their students and their supervisees , and they are additionally obliged to evaluate the performance of these students and supervisees and give them timely feedback . these and other sections of the standard address general concerns in psychology and have no direct bearing on or implications for forensic practice . when deposed , however , the student testified that she had been unsupervised and that the multiphasic personality inventory , second edition she had administered was the first with which she had any experience . she also testified that she had been told by her professor to change some of the answers on the mmpi two based on the fact that the test had been administered in prison . with regard to research , standard eight in the ethics code delineates requirements for obtaining informed consent from research participants , protecting participants from any adverse consequences of participating in a study , and sparing members of a targeted research population from disciplinary or punitive action should they decline to participate . alternatively , if researchers do acquire incriminating information from a participant , whether by intent or inadvertently , can they withhold this information from the authorities without risk of becoming an accessory ? does the researcher feel sufficiently comfortable and have the necessary familiarity with a particular prison facilities and procedures to function effectively in that setting ? the following case illustrates one psychologist public failure to do the homework for which he was ethically responsible . questions of competence , criminal responsibility , and diminished capacity in criminal cases are basically assessment questions , as are questions of competence and personal injury in civil cases , questions of child custody and parental suitability in family law cases , and questions about violence risk . the first three sections of the assessment standard define the essence of ethical assessment practice . two further sections of the standard caution psychologists against using obsolete tests and outdated test results and against promoting the use of psychological assessment techniques by unqualified persons . the forensic specialty guidelines echo the ethics code with regard to conducting assessments , and they elaborate four additional considerations that should guide forensic practice . retaining adequate documentation of assessment findings and making this documentation available as permitted or required by law . it may well be that ethical problems for the practitioner arise more frequently in conducting assessments than in any other forensic activity . a relatively recently emerging ethical problem that merits special mention concerns coaching . beginning psychotherapy with an explicit treatment contract is standard recommended procedure , but it can be overlooked when the therapy has been mandated , as in this instance . the next case illustrates effective implementation in a correctional setting of a pretreatment agreement intended to provide protection for the inmates as well as the institution . he explained to both parties that this condition was necessary to avoid either or both of them striving to look good in the psychologist eyes and make the other one look bad , which would undermine efforts to resolve their marital problems . both parties said that they understood and agreed with this condition . in so doing , they create a role conflict for the therapist , who may be required by the court to disclose information that he or she would ordinarily be ethically obliged to keep confidential . however , the ethics code allows disclosure of confidential information without consent of the individual when mandated or permitted by law for valid purposes . forensic psychologists must deal regularly with two related aspects of principled practice that warrant further elaboration . this is not to say that experts will conduct their professional affairs completely free of prejudices derived from their values . evaluations conducted by psychologists assist the court in determining custody , decision making , access , and parenting plans when parents separate or divorce . at the same time , there has been an increase in the number of books devoted to child custody evaluations and broader forensic psychology practice . in considering the necessary ingredients of child custody and parenting evaluation practice , there are many areas in which a psychologist must gain proficiency . at a minimum , these include child development ; qualities of parenting ; divorce and the impact of the separation and divorce on families ; psychological assessment ; and special issues , such as alienation of children , domestic violence , child abuse , relocation law , family dynamics in cases of extreme conflict , and personality dynamics that contribute to that extreme and ongoing conflict . children are interviewed and observed in offices and their homes . this lengthy process typically takes three to four months to complete and yields a report that is potentially insightful and potentially damaging to the family . child custody and parenting evaluations are among the most difficult and challenging of all psychological evaluations . reasons for this include : the number of people and relationships in the family to be evaluated . the different ages of the children . the range of possible psychopathology . the presence of significant situational factors affecting psychological functioning . the limitations of psychological tests or interview methods designed for this type of assessment . in addition , the guidelines for child custody evaluations in family law proceedings of the american psychological association , designed to provide guidance to those who perform child custody evaluations , direct that psychologists should strive to gain and maintain specialized knowledge , augment their existing skills , acquire sufficient understanding of the specialized child custody literature , and remain familiar with applicable legal standards in the relevant state in which they practice . the model standards state that the child custody evaluation process involves the compilation of information and the formulation of opinions pertaining to the custody or parenting of a child and the dissemination of that information and those opinions to the court , to the litigants , and to the litigants attorneys . thus , evaluators must have the temperament to conduct very comprehensive evaluations and recognize that they may be subjected to anger from parents and an adversarial trial experience . distorted representations or accusations against the evaluator by one or both parents are not uncommon , both in complaints to the court and in complaints to licensing boards . the purpose of custody and parenting evaluations . ethical considerations . basic research the evaluator must know , especially about children and the impact of divorce on children . critical research in special issues , such as conflict between parents , alienated children , domestic violence , sexual abuse , and relocation . the process of custody and parenting evaluation . critical issues in report writing . it is incumbent on the child custody evaluator to be familiar with the law that governs these issues as they pertain to child custody . lewis argued that he elegance of the standard is the simultaneous focus on both the needs of the particular child and , with appropriate weight , the normative child development factors . in jurisdictions where the legislature has identified several specific factors that the judge must consider , the weight assigned to each factor is left to the court . the evaluator task is to gather and present those psychological data related to the best interests factors and answer the questions posed by the court . although the evaluator gathers and analyzes data related to the best interests factors , the judge reaches the ultimate determination of the child best interests based on his or her discretion . in an effort to help judges weigh best interests factors in specific cases , a retired california superior court judge identified certain traits and issues that are common in divorcing families and suggested that these traits be appropriately weighted in specific cases . the traits include those listed next . quality of parenting . quality of coparenting . this analysis can assist the judge in considering and weighting the issues . this topic is discussed more fully in the section on report writing near the end of this chapter . purpose of a custody and parenting evaluation . for the court , the primary purpose of the evaluation is to assist the court in case a settlement is not reached . judges order child custody evaluations for a variety of reasons . these can include those circumstances in which there are significant allegations regarding drug and alcohol abuse , family violence , or child abuse , or significant mental health problems . often a judge is presented with two parents , both of whom appear good enough at parenting but who can not agree on a parenting plan . at other times , one or both parents appear to have significant problems . increasingly , judges look to mental health professionals to help them understand complex psychological questions of attachment between the child and his or her parents , sibling relationships , and the developmental needs of children . similar case law decisions in other states would guide custody evaluators as well . although judges are guided by the law in making decisions regarding the best interests of children , they may look to the child custody evaluator to assist in understanding the family dynamics and the relevant psychological factors in order to reach a decision about what is in the child best interests . in many ways , the neutrally appointed child custody evaluator serves as a consultant to the judge , providing critical data about the family for a better understanding of the family dynamics and the needs of the children . the majority of separating parents reach an agreement about parenting and custody issues on their own or with the assistance of their attorneys or legal processes , such as mediation . however , as many as twenty percent of families at some point in time after separation experience high conflict . they can not agree on the parenting plan or how to make decisions for their child , nor are they able to focus on their child needs because of their mutual differences . these parents may disagree on seemingly simple and minor issues , such as what time a child exchange is to take place or whether it is appropriate for the children to eat certain foods . with many of these families , there are allegations of domestic violence or significant mental health problems , alienation or estrangement of children , or substance abuse . the primary value of an evaluation in these circumstances is that the evaluation provides an opportunity for parents to voice their concerns to a neutral expert . by listening to children , evaluators can also identify when they are caught in a loyalty conflict between their parents and describe the impact of this conflict to the parents and the court . it is common for children voices to be absent in the courts in the united states , and participation in a child custody evaluation can help children voice their concerns , share their wishes , and explore their feelings . although the child custody evaluator is not serving as a therapist , the evaluation process may be therapeutic to children who participate in the evaluation . if the evaluator concludes that the child is experiencing significant problems , he or she can refer the child for therapy and help the parents understand their child developmental needs . even a child therapist may not be serving the child best interests if the therapist is only seeing one parent with the child and becomes an advocate for that parent . by having a neutrally appointed child custody evaluator listen to and observe all family members , interview relevant collateral witnesses , and consider everyone input before reaching conclusions about the children best interests , fragmentation is reduced . ultimately , an evaluation is most helpful to the family when the report and conclusions reduce conflict , help parents reach an agreement without going to trial , and keep parents focused on their child needs and best interests . well done evaluations often help parents recognize the need for solution and compromise , and , while mediation may not have been successful prior to the evaluation , settlement may be much more likely after an evaluation . these documents provide considerable guidance for the evaluator . child custody evaluators who are not highly familiar with all of these documents are working at a considerable disadvantage and , therefore , are at increased risk for failing to maximally serve the court and family . maintaining specialized competence . child custody evaluations are a unique type of evaluation , one that requires specialized competence . the model standards list relevant areas for continuing education training for those performing child custody evaluations . the model standards list eighteen areas of expected training for all child custody evaluators and five areas of specialized training for those evaluators performing custody evaluations in those particular areas . these areas of expected training include , among other items : the psychological and developmental needs of children . the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations state , psychologists strive to avoid conflicts of interest and multiple relationships in conducting evaluations , as certain prior roles may impair the objectivity of the child custody evaluator . the appearance of conflict may be equally important to actual conflict in these cases . although there may not be any actual conflict , and although no ethics will have been violated by taking on the evaluation role in these circumstances , evaluators should recognize the risk that a parent who feels wronged by the evaluator recommendations might allege that the evaluator was biased because of these prior relationships .  additionally , because the eppcc requires psychologists to avoid doing harm when it is foreseeable , the evaluator should inform parents that one or both of them may be unhappy at the end of the evaluation process . it is recommended that the evaluator provide this document to the parents and their attorneys in advance of the start of the evaluation . finally , it is also important for the evaluator to inform potential collateral sources of the limits of confidentiality and the purpose for which the collateral information is being gathered . according to guideline ten of the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations , multiple methods of data gathering enhance the reliability and validity of psychologists eventual conclusions , opinions , and recommendations . unique as well as overlapping aspects of various measures contribute to a fuller picture of each examinee abilities , challenges and preferences . these multiple methods usually include , at a minimum : multiple interviews with the parents . unique as well as overlapping aspects of various measures contribute to a fuller picture of each examinee abilities , challenges , and preferences . these multiple methods usually include , at a minimum : multiple interviews with the parents . interviews with children when appropriate . observations of children and parents interacting . it may be helpful to have psychologists understanding of the scope of the evaluation confirmed in a court order , or by stipulation of all parties and their legal representatives . evaluators shall establish the scope of the evaluation as determined by court order or by a signed stipulation by the parties and their attorneys . within this context , it is equally important to provide a description of the risks and benefits of different options available to the court . this topic is discussed in greater detail in the report writing section further on . given the admonition about training , this next section addresses basic research with which all custody evaluators should be familiar . divorce research . the impact of divorce on children has been studied for more than thirty years . children benefit when they are exposed to limited parental conflict and have regular and frequent contact with both of their good enough parents , and when both parents can participate in a wide range of their child life experiences and activities . parenting plans for young children . before two thousand , much of the divorce literature suggested that very young children should not have overnight visits with their noncustodial parent until sometime between the ages of three and five . if conducting a child custody evaluation where young children are at issue , it is critical to know this research . conflict , legal custody , and decision making . less research has focused on legal custody and decision making between parents than on residential schedules . for most parents , conflict decreases over time . when this is necessary , it is primarily so that decisions can be made in a timely and conflict free way . parenting coordinators , who work with a family to help resolve conflicts on an ongoing basis , usually after there are court orders in place , may prove of value when certain highconflict dynamics exist . first discussed by wallerstein and kelly as children who refused visitation with one parent , gardner described what he termed parental alienation syndrome , a phenomenon he described as occurring when a mother who harbored extremely negative feelings about the father influenced the child to reject the father . more recently , a special issue of family court review was devoted to the topic of alienation with a special focus on intervention . domestic violence . with research suggesting that nearly half of all divorcing families experience some type of domestic violence , it is not surprising that many child custody evaluations involve such allegations . this resulted in a more nuanced understanding of family violence and the range of parenting plan options appropriate for these different families . differentiation of types of domestic violence suggests that , in some families , violence is unique to the separation of the parents . additionally , the court order usually provides information about who is responsible for payment and identifies when the report is due , who is entitled to receive a copy , and the limits of confidentiality . it serves as a detailed informed consent document , which is recommended even if the parents have been ordered to participate in the evaluation . interviews with the parents . it is important that psychologists undertaking evaluations in personal injury cases have knowledge of the legal parameters of civil litigation . this includes an understanding of tort law , the civil procedure , and the rules governing expert testimony . tort law . tort law forms the legal framework for personal injury cases . melton point out that , in addition , torts are not directly related to moral conduct insofar as an act may be immoral but not tortious , and provide the example of a bystander failing to save a drowning child . if the psychologist tells someone else what the patient confided , the psychologist would not be living up to this duty . if a psychologist is having coffee with a friend , however , and the friend discloses she is having an affair , the psychologist has no legal duty to keep that information confidential . the second required element is a dereliction or breach . dereliction occurs when the tortfeasor fails to fulfill a duty . a tort action requires that , in addition to the dereliction of duty , some damage must have occurred . suppose , for example , that when the patient just described attempted to get the prescription filled at the pharmacy , the pharmacist recognized that the patient had an allergy to the medication and called the physician , who then prescribed an alternative medication . despite the physician dereliction of duty , the patient suffered no damage . upon leaving the pharmacy , the patient was struck by a car operated by a drunk driver and suffered severe physical injuries . despite the physician dereliction of duty in prescribing the wrong medication , it is more likely that the actions of the drunk driver and not those of the physician would be considered the proximate cause of the patient injuries . a tort action seeks to make the plaintiff whole that is , to return the plaintiff to the state he or she was in prior to the defendant wrongful actions . it might be argued that pointing a gun at someone would constitute an unreasonable risk . failing to act can also be negligent . for example , a preschool teacher who failed to notice that a pupil had wandered out of the school might be considered negligent . process of civil litigation . the complaint identifies the defendant and describes why the plaintiff believes he or she is entitled to damages . this is authorized by frcp rule thirty five . the plaintiff attorney may also choose to have the plaintiff evaluated as a way of providing further evidence supporting the plaintiff claimed injuries or to dispute the findings of the defendant evaluation . in direct examination , the attorney asks nonleading , open ended questions , such as doctor , can you describe your examination of the plaintiff ? rather than doctor , is not it true that the plaintiff has posttraumatic stress disorder ? the purpose of direct examination is to provide the witness the opportunity to give evidence that will support the plaintiff case . if so , what damages should be awarded to the plaintiff ? either party may choose to appeal the verdict . expert witness in civil litigation . in personal injury cases , a psychologist may be retained as an expert by either the plaintiff or the defendant . the plaintiff can elect to be examined by an expert in order to provide evidence of emotional damage or in an attempt to dispute the findings of the defendant expert . if the findings of the examination do not appear to be helpful to the plaintiff case , it is likely that the plaintiff will not request a written report from the expert or disclose the expert as a potential witness . this report must be detailed and disclose all the procedures used , the opinions reached , and the foundations for each opinion . in return , the plaintiff is required to provide the defendant any reports under the plaintiff control addressing these same issues . ethical issues in personal injury work . when psychologists are engaged in forensic work , they have increased exposure to legal risks . the parties involved in the legal system have no obligation to safeguard the professional or legal interests of the experts participating in the process . consequently , psychologists may face ethical challenges engendered by the adversarial nature and the differing professional responsibilities , agendas , and goals of those working in the legal system . the ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct contains both aspirational goals and enforceable rules of conduct for psychologists . because the ethical standards are written broadly so as to be applicable to psychologists working in a range of professional roles and circumstances , psychologists doing forensic work may benefit from the additional guidance provided by the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology . conducting an evaluation in a personal injury case requires that the psychologist understand his or her role in this process . whether the psychologist is retained by the plaintiff or the defendant , his or her role is to provide an accurate and objective assessment of the plaintiff . this role is distinctly different from the role of a treating psychologist and the role that the attorneys play . the role of the consultant is to provide expertise to the attorney in preparing and litigating the case . this might include reviewing and commenting on the plaintiff treatment records , assisting with jury selection , reviewing a report summarizing the examination completed by the opposing party expert , reviewing the depositions of the opposing party experts , providing questions for cross examination of opposing experts , and conducting research . in addition , data must be interpreted appropriately . the inferences made must be reasonable and based on the data that were collected . the sgfp stress the importance of utilizing multiple sources of data and attempting to corroborate data by comparing information across sources . this distinction requires that the psychologist clearly understand the facts that are at issue and how data can be collected to address those facts specifically . collecting data that are not relevant wastes time and the financial resources of the retaining party . it also serves to confuse the issues and make it more difficult to reach and clearly explicate opinions . it is important that the psychologist carefully review the expert disclosure before it is submitted to be sure that it does not misrepresent his or her opinions or overstate the certainty with which those opinions are held . nature of psychological damage . courts have long allowed claims based on physical harm , and all jurisdictions now allow claims of emotional harm proximately related to physical injuries . as described earlier in this chapter , the fit between clinical diagnostic data and legal questions is imperfect . in establishing the existence of psychological damage , functional capacity is more relevant than a diagnostic label . the type of trauma necessary for a diagnosis of ptsd is clearly outlined in criterion a of the dsm . the trauma must involve experiencing or witnessing an event characterized by actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the integrity of self or others leading to a response of intense fear , helplessness , or horror . consider the following two scenarios : scenario one : while receiving treatment at an inpatient psychiatric facility , a woman was awakened during the night by a male employee who restrained her in her bed while he groped her breasts and genitals . in some cases , existing symptoms might be worsened or exacerbated but not caused by the event . conceptually , determining causality seems simple : compare the plaintiff current functioning with his or her functioning prior to the event . this case is an example of an eggshell plaintiff . despite his history of unimpaired functioning , the man experience of violent abuse at the hands of his stepfather made him especially vulnerable to the stress of the armed robbery . although his reaction was extreme , he may be entitled to compensation from the defendant for all the damage he suffered , even though it is in excess of what the average person would have experienced . the attorney typically identifies the party he or she represents , describes the case in general terms , and inquires about the expert experience and knowledge as it relates to the issues involved . the attorney also identifies the other parties and attorney involved in the litigation to determine if the expert has a conflict of interest . the expert should request that the retaining attorney provide all available records relating to the case , but the expert should not begin working on the case until the retainer and letter of agreement have been received . it is important to understand that the attorney , not the examinee , is the expert client . as mentioned earlier , if the expert is to examine the plaintiff and offer testimony , the expert commitment is to objectivity and impartiality , not to advocating for the retaining attorney client . by contrast , when the examiner has been retained by the defense , the plaintiff may be guarded , defensive , or even hostile as a result of assuming the examiner has been hired to attack his or her case . because of this , regardless of by whom the examiner has been hired , it is important for the examiner to help the plaintiff understand that he or she is objective and unbiased . before beginning the examination of the plaintiff , unless the examination has been courtordered , the expert must obtain the plaintiff informed consent . the examiner can facilitate this process by expressing a desire to understand the plaintiff point of view , by emphasizing the expert role as an independent fact finder , and by treating the plaintiff in a professional and respectful manner . conducting the evaluation . the evaluation of the plaintiff should address the specific questions presented by the retaining attorney . by utilizing a variety of sources , the expert will be able to compare information across sources so as to obtain a more complete and objective understanding of the plaintiff condition and functional capacity . documents and background information . it is recommended that the expert review records prior to meeting with the plaintiff . doing this provides an overview of the plaintiff situation and will call attention to any gaps in the information that has been provided . written records can be especially useful in trying to understand the plaintiff baseline functioning , particularly when the examiner has access to school transcripts , standardized test scores , or psychological or psychoeducational evaluations that were performed prior to the events in question . depositions tend to be quite detailed and cover topics including the plaintiff functioning prior to the alleged injury , the events leading to the alleged injury , and the plaintiff condition subsequent to the alleged injury . depositions of the plaintiff mental health treatment providers can help in understanding the plaintiff condition and progress in treatment . this is especially true if the actual treatment notes are handwritten and difficult to decipher and lacking in detail , to decipher or lacking in detail . given the amount of information to be covered , it is important for the expert to maintain control over the structure of the interview . the examiner should focus on obtaining detailed descriptive information from the plaintiff about his or her functioning before and after the injury rather than asking the plaintiff to provide conclusive statements about his or her condition . when psychologists are asked to examine a personal injury plaintiff , it is usually assumed that the examination will involve psychological testing . psychological testing can be a valuable source of information that can be used to both formulate and confirm hypotheses as well as to disconfirm hypotheses about psychological constructs relevant to the legal issue . therefore , unless the plaintiff is a child or an adolescent , symptoms of a personality disorder could be assumed to have been present and may have had an influence on the plaintiff functioning and adjustment , prior to the injury that is the subject of the litigation . psychological testing provides a standardized method for assessing the plaintiff current symptoms , by comparing the plaintiff symptom report to the reports of individuals in normal or clinical samples . the mmpi was the most frequently named instrument in these surveys . boccaccini and brodsky , for example , found the mmpi was used in eighty nine percent of emotional injury cases by the psychologists who responded to their survey . ultimately , the decision regarding which tests to select for a given evaluation is left to the examiner . a good starting point is to consider the psycholegal questions the evaluation is to address . in addition , these tests include sophisticated scales for the detection of exaggerated or other distorted response styles . when selecting instruments to address the plaintiff response style , the nature of the plaintiff reported symptoms should be considered . because trial competency issues are raised substantially more often than the insanity defense , psychologists involved in forensic assessment and consultation are likely to have more experience with competency evaluations than those of criminal responsibility . estimates are that approximately sixty competency evaluations are conducted in the united states annually . in this chapter , we present an overview of competency laws , research , and methods of assessment , with the aim of providing forensic psychologists with the basic information necessary to conduct competency evaluations . we do not believe , however , that this chapter will sufficiently prepare a novice forensic psychologist to carry out such evaluations . the issues surrounding competency determinations are highly complex ; therefore , an evaluator needs not only a high level of clinical knowledge and skill but also a sophisticated knowledge of the legal system . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . defining competency . provisions allowing for a delay of trial because a defendant was incompetent to proceed have long been a part of the judicial system due process standards . in dusky , the supreme court held : it is not enough for the district judge to find that the defendant is oriented to time and place and has some recollection of events , but that the test must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him . what is meant by sufficient present ability ? how does one determine whether a defendant has a rational as well as factual understanding ? to be sure , some courts and legislatures have provided some direction to evaluators in the form of articulated dusky standards , but the forensic evaluator is left largely unguided except by a common principle , that evaluators can not reach a finding of incompetency independent of the facts of the legal case . practice standards are more clearly delineated at present , and , as a result , practice in this area continues to improve . in the past , evaluators typically were employed in state psychiatric hospital settings and were not formally trained in the assessment of competency or in matters of the law . for example , research has provided evidence that the presence of psychosis was not sufficient by itself for a finding of incompetency , and modern empirical studies of competency reports have demonstrated that evaluators rarely make that simple conceptual error . the specific psycholegal abilities required of a defendant are the most important aspect of assessing fitness . the contextual nature of competence has been explored . some researchers and scholars have argued that competence should be considered within the context in which it is to be used . the importance of a contextual determination of specific psycholegal abilities has been repeatedly demonstrated by empirical findings that abilities in one area of functioning are rarely homogenous with those in other areas of functioning . supreme court decisions in both the united states and canada , however , have confused this issue by finding that the standard by which competency to be judged is not context specific . that court concluded that there is no difference between the essential abilities needed in making active choices about waiving counsel , making decisions at trial , confessing , or pleading guilty . it ruled that different standards of competency should not be applied for different aspects of criminal proceedings and that the test to be used is one of limited cognitive capacity in each of these circumstances . while the decision to plead guilty is undeniably a profound one , it is no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial . nor do we think that a defendant who waives his right to the assistance of counsel must be more competent than the defendant who does not , since there is no reason to believe that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional rights . subsequently , the united states supreme court , in indiana edwards , addressed the issue of whether there should be a different standard for competence to stand trial and competence to represent oneself . ahmad edwards , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia , attempted to steal a pair of shoes from a department store in indiana , and , when security officers tried to apprehend him , he opened fire . therefore , it appears that a conservative estimate of evaluation and restoration costs in the united states is upward of seven hundred million annually . widespread use of screening instruments would serve to lower these costs , because the majority of individuals for whom competence is clearly not an issue would be screened out . only those defendants whom the screening instrument has identified as potentially incompetent would then be referred for a more indepth assessment . screening instruments can be administered in community based settings as well as in local jails or courthouses , thereby also serving to eliminate the unnecessary detention of clearly competent individuals . nevertheless , cochrane and his colleagues conducted a retrospective records review of all incompetent defendants who were involuntarily treated under sell in the united states federal court system between two thousand and three and two thousand and nine . they found that seventy nine percent of those diagnosed with a psychotic disorder responded well to treatment and ultimately were deemed competent to stand trial . it is feasible to look at the predictive validity of decisions about competent defendants , but it is not possible to assess the decisions about incompetent defendants , because they are remanded for treatment and their judicial proceedings are suspended . concurrent validity is also difficult to investigate , because it is not useful to examine correlations with other measures if one adopts a functional , case by case assessment of a defendant competency . if a defendant were unable to participate , then the trial could be stopped . if a verdict had already been reached and the defendant was convicted , the verdict could be set aside . we suspect that , in a significant percentage of trials , alleged incompetent defendants would be able to participate . in addition to the obvious advantages to defendants , the use of a provisional trial could provide valuable information about what should be expected of a defendant in certain judicial proceedings . these decisions are of interest because they support the view that evaluators can not reach a finding of incompetency independent of the facts of the legal case . similarly , a defendant may be psychotic and still be found competent to stand trial if the symptoms do not impair the defendant functional ability to consult with his or her attorney and otherwise rationally participate in the legal process . some cases are more complex than others and may , as a result , require different types of psycholegal abilities . the extent to which the evidence in suit could be extrinsically reconstructed in view of the defendant amnesia . such evidence would include evidence relating to the crime itself as well as any reasonable possible alibi . the extent to which the government assisted the defendant and his counsel in that reconstruction . the strength of the prosecution case . most important here will be whether the government case is such as to negate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence . unfortunately , research findings have demonstrated that evaluators often do not address an appropriate range of psycholegal abilities and most often do not draw a connection between the defendant emotional or behavioral impairments and impaired psycholegal capacities . we now turn to a review of the history of competency assessment methods . competency assessment tools . prior to the nineteen sixties , there were no standard methods for assessing competency . although it has high levels of interrater reliability in terms of scoring the incomplete sentence format , studies comparing classifications based on cst cutoff scores and hospital evaluation decisions reveal that it has a high falsepositive rate . the results of these studies lead to a mixed review of the cst . although it appears that the cst is reliably scored , serious questions can be raised about its usefulness as a screening device , because of the potential for misclassifying potentially competent defendants . in subsequent studies , the cai has shown high levels of trained inter examiner agreement and examiner outcome agreement . as such , the cai may be useful as a screening device or as a fullblown interview measure . its primary disadvantage , relative to the instruments reviewed next , is in the range of psycholegal abilities articulated and its lack of focus on the nexus between psychopathology and psycholegal impairment . interdisciplinary fitness interview . the interdisciplinary fitness interview is designed to assess both the legal and psychopathological aspects of competency . they were in agreement on ninety seven percent of their final determinations of competency . by type of decision , the interviewers found fifty eight defendants to be competent and seventeen incompetent , and they disagreed on only two cases . fitness interview test . the fitness interview test was created in nineteen eighty four to structure fitness to stand trial assessments conducted in canada . it has since been extensively revised , and the current version is referred to as the fitness interview test . the fitr focuses on the psycholegal abilities of the individual . georgia court competency test . the georgia court competency test was originally developed by wildman and has since gone through a number of revisions . the original version consisted of seventeen items , and the revised version , referred to as the mississippi state hospital revision , consists of twenty one items . the first seven items of the gcctmsh require the defendant to visually identify the location of certain participants in the courtroom using a courtroom drawing as a reference . this is followed by questions related to the function of certain individuals in the courtroom , the charges that the defendant is facing , and his or her relationship with the lawyer . the macarthur competence assessment tool criminal adjudication was developed to assess three main subconstructs of the psycholegal abilities : understanding , reasoning , and appreciation . it comprises twenty two items that are grouped into three sections . the examiner begins by reading a hypothetical vignette to the defendant to ground the first two sections . the first section assesses the defendant ability to understand information about the legal system and the process . the second section assesses the defendant ability to reason . the first five items in this section assess the defendant ability to consider two pieces of factual information and identify the most important or legally relevant piece of information that should be disclosed to a lawyer . the last three items require the defendant to think through mock legal options and to evaluate them in various ways . the final section assesses the defendant ability to appreciate his or her own legal circumstances and situation . this section departs from the hypothetical vignette format to explore the defendant beliefs and perceptions about his or her personal role as a defendant and how he or she will be treated during the course of adjudication . these items are scored on the basis of the reasons that the defendant provides for his or her judgment and whether they are plausible or implausible . it is important to note that the authors of the maccatca emphasize that this instrument was developed for use as a tool rather than a test of competence and that it constitutes only one component of an overall assessment of competence . failure to identify individuals with intellectual disabilities and subsequently refer them for evaluations of competency is often a result of the tendency of these individuals to attempt to hide their limitations . in a virginia study , twenty three percent of defendants diagnosed with mild mr were deemed incompetent , whereas sixty eight percent of those with moderate mr were found incompetent . in terms of restoration to competency for individuals diagnosed with mr , bonnie hypothesized that the possibility of restoration is highly unlikely . in a sample of thirty eight incompetent defendants with such a diagnosis in virginia , only sixteen percent were considered likely to be restored , and it was estimated that restoration was unlikely for approximately sixty six percent of the defendants . although further research certainly is required in this area , research efforts that have examined issues of intellectual disability within the criminal justice system beginning in the early nineteen nineties can be viewed as a step in the right direction . the nineteen nineties also saw an increase in research examining issues of competency within the juvenile population . competency has become more important for adolescents , because the juvenile justice system has shifted to a more punishmentoriented model as opposed to a rehabilitative one , and increasing numbers of adolescents are being either waived or transferred to adult court . research on competency to stand trial in juveniles has examined issues related to the evaluation of developmental maturity , decisionmaking abilities , and other factors that might impact adjudicative competence . assessing criminal responsibility . much has been written about criminal responsibility and issues of insanity or mental state at the time of the offense . in this chapter , we focus on three major areas : a review of issues related to the assessment of criminal responsibility , including the structure of these evaluations , instruments developed to guide evaluators , the role of psychotic symptoms , particularly delusions , in the evaluation of criminal responsibility , and issues pertaining to the treatment and release of insanity acquittees . on the other hand , to have a theory of action and responsibility that embodies our cultural sense of fairness and justice , one that reflects our increasing knowledge of psychological processes , in general , and psychotic processes , in particular , we have to consider the conjunction of the proscribed behavior and an appropriate degree and type of intentionality and mental capacity in ascribing guilty or culpable ownership of an act . this concept may be traced , in a continuous line of development , through greek and roman law wherein the concept of culpa is distinguished from dolus . children under the age of seven , for example , were considered doli incapax , that is , not possessed of sufficient discretion and intelligence to distinguish between right and wrong and hence incapable of criminal intention or malice . this theological opposition was based on a belief that god could not properly hold an infant , idiot , or lunatic justly responsible . it is interesting to note that the age at which children generally are assumed to be criminally responsible corresponds to the age within all major religions at which they usually pass through a certification ritual where they are deemed morally responsible in the eyes of god . naghten trial is assumed to be the starting place for the test that : to establish a defense on the ground of insanity , it must be clearly proved that , at the time of the committing of the act , the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason , from disease of the mind , as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing ; or , if he did know it , that he did not know he was doing what was wrong . isaac ray had already published his treatise on the medical jurisprudence of insanity in which he attacked the narrowness of such formulations as not according with modern knowledge of the forms of mental disorder and their influence on behavior , affect , and cognition . the same debates that occur today over the scope of what should be included under knowledge , appreciation , and the like were influential in court decisions of the day . to emphasize this , judge bazelon advocated a version of a test first proposed by the british royal commission on capital punishment in nineteen fifty three : a defendant is not responsible if at the time of his unlawful conduct his mental or emotional processes or behavior controls were impaired to such an extent that he can not justly be held responsible for his act . in a strongly worded dissent , it was argued that the potential threat to society created by the volitional prong ignored empirical data that . provide little or no support for these fearsome perceptions and in many respects refute them . the dissenting argument cited various studies undercutting the perceptions of the misuse of the insanity defense . it was also motivated by knowledge that an elimination of the insanity verdict itself might be considered unconstitutional , as it had been in strasburg and underwood state . the gbmi verdict was intended to make it more difficult to reach a verdict of ngri , with the hope that most jurors would respond to the superficial logic of the verdict . opponents of the gbmi verdict have argued that it should be abolished on the grounds that it confuses and deceives jurors . to address the punitive and abolitionist motivation , defenders of the gbmi legislation added a gloss of rehabilitation by arguing that the new verdict provided an explicit means of recognizing that some of those sent to prison were in need of mental health treatment . in commenting on this entire enterprise , professor richard bonnie bluntly wrote , the guilty but mentally ill verdict should be rejected as nothing more than moral sleight of hand . as packer recently noted , none of the gbmi statutes incorporates conditions leading to lesser punishment , thereby fostering misperceptions regarding the meaning of the verdict . jurors are not entitled to know the nature of the sentences associated with the various forms of mental state defenses , and individuals who are found gbmi are subject to the same penalties as those found guilty . assessment of mental state at the time of the offense . with or without the defendant consent , no testimony by the expert based on the statement , and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant has introduced . as noted earlier , however , jurisdictions vary widely , and the examiner must conform his or her practice to the local rules . it is also good practice to allow the defendant to provide his or her version of the events surrounding the time of the offense before the examiner introduces any contradictory evidence or challenges the defendant on any noted inconsistencies . doing this often involves comparing the defendant reports of his or her mental state and behaviors with various aspects of crime scene evidence . this part of the interview resembles a psychological autopsy . two specialized forensic assessment instruments have been developed to assist in the evaluation of mso . although both of these instruments were developed in the nineteen eighties , standards of forensic practice continue to move in the direction of incorporating forensic assessment instruments in the evaluation of psycholegal issues . twenty four mental health professionals were trained to use the mse and were then asked to assess thirty six cases . they were given only a description of the charge and the preliminary hearing transcript prior to their assessment . the limitations of the mse have been addressed in the literature . given the lack of research on its reliability and the limited validity data available , the mse should be viewed as a guide for evaluators to ensure that relevant areas of inquiry are addressed . indeed , evaluators can include the mse in a comprehensive evaluation that would include multiple sources of data . rogers criminal responsibility assessment scales . rogers has reported modest interrater reliabilities at the item level , with lower values associated with the product question , which is one of the most frequent sources of disagreement in contested trials . final judgments with the rcras have also been associated with reasonable levels of agreement between examiners and triers of fact . these findings are in general accord with the levels of agreement found between clinicians and courts in other studies of final judgment that use no formalized interviews or rating scales . these less structured approaches have been shown to be empirically useful in various contexts , but they have not been studied in the same fashion as the rcras . the rcras and less structured mso evaluation techniques make their most important contributions by clarifying the underlying bases for professional judgment for the trier of fact , thus potentially highlighting the areas of disagreement so that expert testimony can be of more assistance to judge or juror . third party information . it is a commonly accepted standard of practice that forensic evaluators examine the consistency of mental health history and other archival data along with details of the crime scene and witnesses accounts of the defendant before , during , and after the alleged incident . this consideration of consistency is relevant to issues of malingering and aids in supporting or challenging various psychological interpretations of the defendant mso . the importance of this aspect of a forensic examination at the time of the offense has been addressed in numerous sources . moreover , delusions have been shown to be specifically and substantially related to violence . in an extensive analysis of case records , hafner and boker found that seventy percent of individuals who were diagnosed with schizophrenia and accused of homicide harbored delusional beliefs about their relationship with their victim . arguably , the same logic also applies to delusions that would justify the actions . notwithstanding the centrality of this issue in assessing criminal responsibility , there are few empirical studies or practice standards available to aid in assessing the delusionality of beliefs . in grayarea cases , or cases in which defendants are not clearly disordered , the classification of beliefs as delusional is presumably a major source of disagreement among examiners . when a false belief involves a value judgment , it is regarded as a delusion only when the judgment is so extreme as to defy credibility . although this definition is adequate for most clinical and clinical forensic purposes , its shortcomings are readily apparent when one attempts to delineate its boundaries . as noted , there is often no standard of proof by which one can assess the falsity of beliefs in many religious , political , or identity systems . it is difficult to determine the extent to which the nature of a belief , its experience , or its expression must deviate from that accepted by a designated subgroup to be classified as delusional . clearly , examiners must have considerable knowledge of the social , religious , political , and even scientific context of a defendant belief to adequately assess its delusionality . failure to carefully consider patients cultural and religious backgrounds often results in misdiagnoses . overvalued ideas can be understood as exaggerations , diminutions , or combinations of phenomena which we ourselves experience . in contrast , a secondary delusion is understandable only in the sense that it emerges through one process of reasoning about psychopathological experiences . a primary delusion is not understandable because it originates in a direct , immediate experience of new meaning unmediated by thought and unconnected to the person fundamental personality . a number of factors contribute to this typically lengthy treatment and slow release process . first , ngri acquittees are likely to be severely mentally disordered persons for whom currently available treatment , both biochemical and psychosocial , has been ineffective . this is not because they are necessarily bad people or nonadherent to treatment regimens , but because , contrary to medical and pharmaceutical company myth , about onethird of severely mentally disordered individuals fail to show meaningful clinical responses to such treatment . such individuals may also become nonadherent as a result of a complex psychological process . they also found psychologists and psychiatrists to generally agree on recommendations for the ultimate release of insanity acquittees , with inpatient recommendations more commonly occurring for those with histories of self injury and suicide attempts , family or other psychosocial issues , and a lack of structured activities in the community . psychologists also tended to recommend commitment when a weapon was used during the commission of the crime , and both groups were more likely to recommend commitment when a person was transferred to the hospital from jail as opposed to from the community . what we do not have is informative data on the differences between similar individuals treated in correctional versus forensic mental health contexts . we know of no empirical studies of this issue . with respect to mental health economics , the question is whether society eventually pays more or less for treating mentally disordered offenders in prison versus forensic mental health systems . next we present a brief overview of each of these three areas . the reader is referred to other sources for a more detailed and comprehensive review of this literature . research on ngri verdicts . research on the empirical realities of the adjudication of criminal responsibility has continued to demonstrate the same basic phenomena since earlier reviews . research indicates that the ngri defense is seldom raised , averaging less than one percent of total felony indictments , and is highly variable in its success rate , with a modal rate of twenty five percent for those who raise the issue . cirincione , steadman , and mcgreevy surveyed seven states with respect to the frequency of insanity pleas and the likelihood of insanity acquittals and found an inverse relationship between the two factors . that is , states wherein insanity plea rates were high had a lower insanity acquittal rate . research on interexaminer agreement is of limited utility , because it focuses on global agreement . research on the logic and structure of examiner decision making in competency to stand trial evaluations has demonstrated high levels of global agreement in ultimate conclusions but poor agreement in examiner logic , particularly as it pertains to defendants specific abilities and incapacities . in maryland , clinical prognosis was the most critical variable , with those defendants with schizophrenia being less likely than those with other major mental illnesses to be granted conditional release . in ohio , the nature of the crime was the most significant predictor , with serious offenders less likely to be released . it is somewhat concerning that in new york , the variables most predictive of conditional release were related neither to crime characteristics nor psychiatric variables . in a recent study , dirkslinhorst and kondrat analyzed twenty seven years of ngri acquittals in missouri . of the twenty four females whose release was revoked , six were released again , and five of the six engaged in behaviors leading to a second revocation , suggesting that prior revocation is a risk factor for future revocation . research on judicial instruction . jurors are expected to determine an appropriate verdict by conscientiously applying the law to a fair evaluation of the evidence . in an analog study , finkel found no verdict differences among mock jurors who were provided idra instructions , ali instructions , or very narrow wild beast instructions . in fact , researchers have found that it is typically inconsequential whether jurors are given any test or standard . mock jurors who receive no insanity definitions or who are told to use their best lights judgment to decide a case produce verdict patterns indistinguishable from those of mock jurors who receive various insanity test instructions . the fact that jurors determine whether a defendant is sane or insane without the guidance of specific legal instructions suggests that they rely on their own knowledge about insanity and other cognitive structures to make these decisions . such does not imply that jurors nullify instructions ; rather , that their own implicit theories of insanity and responsibility guide their interpretation of the admittedly vague and nonspecific linguistic terms of insanity standards . uninstructed juries were more likely to shift toward a harsher verdict after deliberation , whereas instructed juries were more likely to shift toward more lenient verdicts after deliberation . these results underscore the importance not only of dispositional instructions but also the opportunity for jurors to deliberate as juries . research on jury and juror decision making . jurors caserelevant attitudes . the insanity defense is controversial and involves scientific as well as politicalmoral issues . although public opinion polls and empirical studies often find support for the basic logic of the insanity defense , they consistently reveal powerful negative attitudes toward it . especially troubling is the robust finding that these prevalent , potentially inflexible , negative attitudes toward the insanity defense considerably influence mock jurors verdicts in insanity cases . although insanity defense cases likely invoke equally powerful biases , the case law reflects a trend in which judges refuse to inquire about bias against the insanity defense or even allow the empanelment of jurors who express biases against the defense or against persons with mental illness . using a rationally derived categorization scheme , they found that mock jurors cited multiple , rational reasons for their decisions in each case . these constructions , or interpretations , are more strongly associated with jurors verdicts than the case as objectively presented and appear unaffected by judicial instruction . based on these findings , several commentators have argued that jurors render insanity verdicts by carefully resorting to their personal knowledge or implicit theories of insanity . similarly , clinically oriented research will help further develop our assessment techniques and interventions for defendants for whom criminal responsibility is an issue . we then review the major approaches to risk assessment , their advantages and disadvantages , and corresponding research . then we provide a step by step overview of the clinical risk assessment process . next , we survey recent developments in the law that concern the admissibility in court of such assessments and the legal standards for depriving individuals of their liberty based on such assessments . we conclude by recommending several fruitful areas for research and practice concerning violence risk assessment to tackle . landmark early research and commentary . the first comprehensive review of the research literature regarding assessments of dangerousness by mental health professionals was john monahan influential monograph predicting violent behavior : an assessment of clinical techniques , which appeared in nineteen eighty one . monahan updated his nineteen eighty one review in another prominent article published in nineteen eighty four . litwack and schlesinger reviewed the research literature through nineteen eighty five for the first edition of the present volume and arrived at conclusions somewhat different from those of monahan . litwack , kirschner , and wack reviewed the relevant studies from nineteen eighty five to nineteen ninety and concluded , echoing both monahan and litwack and schlesinger , that research had not negated the possibility that clinical evaluations of dangerousness can have a unique and useful role to play in making determinations of dangerousness that our society has decided should be made . using clinical examinations , extensive life histories , and psychological tests , a team of mental health professionals evaluated five hundred and ninety two males convicted of assaultive offenses and sentenced to a special facility for continued evaluation and treatment . of these men , three hundred and eighty six were eventually classified as not dangerous by the evaluating team and released . in addition , forty nine men classified as still dangerous were also released by legal authorities against the advice of the professional staff . during a five year community follow up , eight percent of the patients considered by the evaluating teams to be not dangerous were found to have committed a serious assaultive crime . by contrast , thirty five percent of the patients viewed as dangerous by clinicians , but nevertheless released , were discovered to have committed a serious crime . thus , kozol eventually may have developed an assessment system that was able to predict which of their sample of patients would be dangerous if released with at least fifty percent accuracy . second , the recidivism rate reported by kozol for the patients deemed dangerous whether thirty five percent or fifty percent was presumably lower than the actual recidivism rate . hall has pointed out that there is good reason to believe that only twenty percent of serious crimes lead to an arrest . finally , and most important , the judgments of dangerousness at issue in this study , like most judgments of dangerousness , were never predictions of violence to begin with . the patients supposedly predicted to be violent were actually , and more conservatively , not recommended for release . clinical concerns regarding a patient potential dangerousness that lead to a conclusion that the patient can not be recommended for release do not equate with a prediction that a patient will be violent if released . yet , as a result of judicial decisions , these patients were nevertheless transferred to civil hospitals . follow up studies indicated that only a small percentage had to be returned to secure facilities and only a small number of patients ultimately released to the community were rearrested for violent offenses . these findings indicate that , in the past , many mentally ill individuals were wrongfully confined in unduly restrictive facilities because of erroneous assumptions that they were too dangerous to live in less restrictive conditions ; therefore , determinations of dangerousness for the purpose of preventive detention warrant careful judicial scrutiny . litwack concluded that the samples and assessment techniques employed were so different that the validity , or invalidity , of the predictions of dangerousness at issue in the study of the dixon patients utterly irrelevant to evaluating the validity and legitimacy of the assessments of dangerousness he surveyed . moreover , litwack pointed out , once even a semblance of an individualized examination was performed . on the dixon patients , only a distinct minority were still deemed to be dangerous . in short , it is wrong to draw conclusions about assessments of dangerousness in other much less all circumstances from findings regarding such assessments in particular circumstances . in terms of specific , defined models , two primary contemporary models of violence risk assessment are commonly used in applied settings : actuarial and structured professional judgment . there has been a vast amount of research on these models , particularly spj , since the previous edition of this volume . the actuarial method is rooted in the classic human decision making debate between clinical prediction and actuarial prediction . as we reviewed earlier , correctly or otherwise , much of the early research on violence risk assessment or dangerousness led investigators to conclude that clinical predictions by mental health professionals were poor . although we believe that clinical experience is essential for conducting risk assessments , we also believe that exercising such experience within a structured decision making context is necessary . although the traditional definition of clinical prediction stressed the absence of rules and the unfettered application of unchecked intuition , clinicians may and do take into account whatever available data they deem relevant to their assessments , including data that can be obtained only through clinical methods . however , a purely unstructured approach has substantial weaknesses , given the absence of guidance to decision makers . for instance , clinicians may pay undue attention to factors that are not associated with violence . conversely , they may fail to attend to important factors that are indeed associated with violence . given a complete absence of structure , there may be inconsistency across raters as well as inconsistency within raters but across cases . that is , there may be little transparency in unstructured clinical decision making , which poses problems in legal settings because such decisions can not adequately be reviewed . this places examinees rights , as well as continuity of care , at jeopardy . actuarial prediction . by contrast , the actuarial approach to prediction is a formal method that uses an equation , a formula , a graph , or an actuarial table to arrive at a probability , or expected value , of some outcome . this practice is highly problematic because derivation predictive estimates which are linked to the specific characteristics of unique samples tend to change upon cross validation in new samples . as such , actuarial risk assessment instruments produce estimated probabilities of violence over some future time for persons who fall into certain score ranges on the test . the actuarial approach has a number of vulnerabilities that have yet to be overcome in the risk assessment field . that is , given myriad sample characteristics , it is possible that actuarial instruments contain sample specific risk factors and exclude important risk factors with broad support in the literature . strict actuarial approaches disallow consideration of risk factors not included on the instrument . these approaches presume that the original research considered all potentially relevant risk factors and all potentially relevant risk factors are contained on the instrument . a major problem with the actuarial approach stems from its sample dependence . risk factors are selected through certain statistical procedures and given weights through one of any number of methods . as a result , the estimated probabilities of violence are all dependent on a host of sample specific characteristics . indeed , the onus of demonstrating the stability lies on those who use actuarial methods . to further muddy the waters , it is unclear whether sample based estimates should be applied to the individuals within those samples at all . earlier we noted that one problem with actuarial methods is the exclusion of potentially important risk factors either because they were not included among the set of candidate variables in the first place or because they did not make it onto the final instrument in the given derivation sample . consider the static ninety nine , a widely used actuarial instrument for sexual violence risk assessment . in our view , this highly limits the scope and comprehensiveness of a risk assessment , to the extent that risk factors of potentially vital importance would not be considered by the decision maker . correlation was reduced from forty four in the development sample to thirty six in author conducted cross validations and to thirty in independent samples . they concluded that the results of this study do not support the generalizability of the original probabilities associated with the prediction bins , although the lsir bins performed much better than the vrag bins and that this study does not support the use of the initial validation probability bins of either instrument with our sample . they concluded that the results of this study do not support the generalizability of the original probabilities associated with the prediction bins , although the lsir bins performed much better than the vrag bins and that this study does not support the use of the initial validation probability bins of either instrument with our sample . in general , spj attempts to retain some of the strengths of the clinical approach , such as its relevance to treatment and risk management and its utility in individual case formulation . in addition , like the actuarial approach , it aims to attain solid empirical evidence and to couch professional judgments within a structured context . examples of major spj instruments are provided in table fourteen next we briefly describe the main features of the spj approach . logical item selection is a process involving a thorough review of scientific , theoretical , and professional literatures on the topic of relevance and the selection of risk factors with broad support across a number of numerous samples and contexts . its purpose is to derive a set of risk factors that minimizes the likelihood that important risk factors are excluded from an assessment or that irrelevant factors are included . although some commentators have criticized the lack of a numerical assignment system , research shows that this decision making system is as accurate as or more accurate than actuarial classification systems . spj approaches do not provide a priori weighting to risk factors , as most actuarial instruments do . that is , in most spj measures , all factors are judged to be present , absent , or partially possibly present . all spj violence risk instruments contain numerous potentially changeable risk factors that inform clinicians judgments about what sort of risk reduction strategies are necessary in a given case . facilitation of risk management . comparative evaluative research . how do these approaches fare , both singly and comparatively , in terms of evaluating risk for violence ? in this section , we draw some conclusions from the literature on this topic . there are now hundreds of risk assessment studies especially on actuarial and spj approaches . even when the patients preadmission history of violence was controlled for , the clinicians still did statistically better than chance , leading the authors to conclude that this study . show that clinical judgment has been undervalued in previous research . however , because a significant percentage of the patients who did act violently in the community were not identified as dangerous by the clinicians and because a considerable percentage of patients who did not act violently in the community were in the predicted violent group , the authors also concluded that the low sensitivity and specificity of these judgments show that clinicians are relatively inaccurate predictors of violence . moreover , in further followup analyses , gardner , lidz , mulvey , and shaw showed that a simple , threeitem actuarial screen outperformed clinicians decisions . thus , this study , considered one of the best to test clinicians predictions , showed lukewarm support for clinicians validity . the clinical predictions showed some association with violence but also showed a good deal of error , inapplicability for women , and inferior performance to a simple actuarial screen . lidz did find that patients about whom clinicians expressed serious concern those who had a summed score of six or above were no more likely to commit violence than patients regarding whom the clinicians had expressed some but less concern . however , a high clinical rating of potential violence does not necessarily mean a judgment that the patient is very likely to commit violence . such a concern may instead reflect a judgment that the patient is at risk for committing serious violence , even if the risk of occurrence is not high . further , to have maximum legal utility , risk assessment methods should assess the risk of legally relevant possible violence that is , violence of legally relevant seriousness , likelihood and imminence , likelihood or imminence . furthermore , the comparison to the actuarial screen may not be entirely appropriate . these analyses compared actuarial and clinical predictions of violence for their accuracy in predicting any community violence versus predicting serious community violence . however , it is questionable , at best , whether the data required for the decision tree could be validly and reliably collected in the emergency room , given patients clinical conditions at that time . at the least , therefore , this study did not convincingly demonstrate that actuarial methods are superior to clinical methods in determining which patients evaluated in psychiatric emergency rooms should or should not be hospitalized involuntarily . a similar pattern was reported for violent recidivism . it should be noted that the objective risk assessments included very few of the major contemporary measures used today and also included study specific actuarial procedures that were not cross validated . in general , the cis overlapped for most instruments , meaning that no clear winner emerged . for institutional violence , effect sizes ranged from a low of eight to a high of twenty eight . for violent recidivism , they ranged from twenty two to thirty two . for violent recidivism , instruments that contained dynamic risk factors intending to focus on risk management and treatment produced larger effect sizes than those without such a focus . spj measures were intermediate . actuarial estimates also tended to produce larger effect sizes than spj measures for sexual recidivism , although there were only six spj studies , and only three of these used summary risk ratings as opposed to the summation of scores . the single instrument with the largest effect sizes with sexual recidivism was the svr twenty , an spj measure , although this was based on only three studies . the authors advised that given the small number of spj studies , caution is warranted in evaluating spj instruments based on this particular metaanalysis . one standout finding was that the interpersonal aspects of the pclr were substantially less predictive compared to the risk assessment instruments and to the other features of the pclr . only two instruments , across various statistical models , added incremental validity to the pclr : the hcr twenty and the offender group reconviction scale . across eighty eight independent studies published between nineteen ninety five and two thousand and eight , the authors evaluated nine instruments . although eighty eight studies were included in the metaanalysis , instrument specific analyses typically were based on no more than twelve studies and typically fewer than ten . consistent with this interpretation , the authors also reported that instruments designed to predict violence fared better than those designed to predict general recidivism . this latter finding was also observed in a recent metaanalysis on an overlapping group of seventy three studies . in this latter metaanalysis , instruments designed to assess risk for violence , collapsed across actuarialspj assessment format , had superior predictive validity than did those instruments designed or used for general criminality , odds ratios of six versus two , respectively . regrettably , most risk assessment metaanalyses suffer the same flaw : they fail to include the summary risk ratings commonly used with the spj approach . singh is an exception , where they were able to use summary risk ratings for twenty two of twenty seven spj studies . quite consistently , summary risk ratings were more strongly associated with violence relative to numeric use . similar to the findings of singh and fazel , guy reported that the hcr twenty summary risk ratings were more strongly related to outcomes when they focused on violence as opposed to nonviolent or general criminality . it is remarkable how many studies of contemporary risk assessment instruments have been conducted , even in the past ten years . metaanalyses should focus on instruments in the ways that they were intended to be used , as was done by guy , singh , and to a lesser extent hanson and mortonbourgon . most metaanalyses use selection criteria that remove a majority of studies that have been conducted on various instruments . there is some evidence that , when instruments are used with the specific outcomes that they were designed to predict , they perform better than when used with nonspecific outcomes . this was evident with the hcr twenty performing better with violence and physical violence than with general antisocial outcomes . of the published studies supporting the use of summary risk ratings , half have tested whether final spj judgments added incrementally to the prediction of violence over and above the numerical use of the instrument , or of a pcl measure , an actuarial measure , or unstructured clinical prediction . the key outcome is whether the addition of the summary risk rating adds in a statistically significant manner to the predictive power of the multivariate model . in all but two of the seventeen studies , incremental validity was observed . for instance , hcr twenty summary risk ratings add incremental validity beyond the numeric use of the instrument among mentally disordered offenders , psychiatric inpatients , forensic patients , and criminal offenders released from prison or on probation or parole . the start summary risk ratings have shown similar incremental validity beyond the screening version of the pcl sv , as have savry summary risk ratings beyond the pcl yv . douglas and colleagues found that the hcr twenty and the vrag both accounted for unique variance in predicting violence ; that is , they both added predictive power over the other . furthermore , they do not suffer the same drawbacks as actuarial methods , discussed earlier . we now turn to a discussion of conducting clinical assessments of risk , with a focus on the steps laid out in the spj model . although these phases are conceptually distinct , there is some debate concerning whether they are independent or separable . some have argued in favor of this view . they see a simple , linear temporal relation between the two . professionals start by completing the assessment phase ; professionals start by completing the prediction phase ; then , if needed , they complete the management phase . regardless of how one conceptualizes or defines the process of evaluating violence risk , then , there seems to be unanimous agreement that comprehensive clinical evaluations incorporate both prediction and management . as unstructured clinical judgment by definition does not provide a welldefined framework for either prediction or management , actuarial decision making provides a framework only for prediction . evaluate the relevance of risk factors . develop scenarios of violence in light of risk factors that are present and relevant . develop management plans in light of scenarios of violence . communicate the evaluation findings . step one : gather critical information . as scott pointed out , before factors can be considered , they must be gathered . the quantity and quality of information reviewed by evaluators sets fundamental limits on the reliability and validity of their subsequent judgments . most spj guidelines make explicit recommendations for gathering information , although the specific topics and sources relevant in a given case vary according to the nature of the risks being assessed and the specifics of the case . we agree with the sage advice from years ago : of paramount importance is a meticulous description of the actual assault . the description of the aggressor in action is often the most valuable single source of information . if there is such a history , the evaluator should construct a timeline of violent incidents to look for evidence of patterns , such as a clear trajectory or triggering events . evaluators must balance comprehensiveness with efficiency by focusing on information that is useful , unique , and trustworthy . with respect to the quality of information , evaluators must make judgments about the credibility of various sources of information on which they relied and attempt to reconcile any contradictory information . for example , there may be contradictory information concerning the extent of the examinee history of violence or the examinee behavior during the most recent act of violence ; the examinee history of employment or intimate relationship problems may be unclear ; or there may be no information concerning the examinee plans for release from hospital or prison into the community . the list of risk factors is intended to be reasonably thorough or comprehensive but by no means exhaustive ; evaluators are encouraged to go beyond the standard risk factors to identify rare or case specific risk factors , should they be able to provide a compelling clinical or logical rationale for doing so . we have opted in this chapter not to provide a detailed review of important violence risk factors , as they are for the most part very well cataloged on contemporary violence risk assessment instruments . determining relevance is an exercise in abductive inference , that is , inference to the best explanation or , as it is more commonly referred to in clinical practice , formulation . formulation of violence risk should be guided by theory , and it is common in the spj approach to use decision theory . the bottom line is that , with very rare exceptions , all people think before they commit violence : they choose whom they commit violence against , when they will commit it , and what kinds of violence they will commit . put simply , they perceived that violence might pay off . they evaluated the possible negative consequences of violence and determined that the costs were acceptable . they evaluated their options for committing violence and determined it was feasible . next , evaluators must make judgments about the examinee potential for violence in light of the presence and relevance of risk factors . simply concluding that an examinee is a high risk for violence or has a fifty four percent chance of violence within ten years is not sufficient for making any kind of reasonable clinical or even legal decision . according to chermack and lynham , scenario planning is a process of positing several informed , plausible and imagined alternative future environments in which decisions about the future may be played out , for the purpose of changing current thinking , improving decision making , enhancing human and organization learning and improving performance . the evaluator considers a scenario in which the trajectory of violence decreases , and the examinee commits a less serious act or even chooses to desist altogether a bestcase or optimistic scenario . multiple scenarios could be developed within each of these four broad categories .
