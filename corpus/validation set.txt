chapter five describes training models and resources in forensic psychology for faculty developing programs of instruction and for students and general practitioners seeking specialized education or supervised experience in forensic psychology . part two comprises five chapters concerning applications of psychology in civil proceedings . chapter six addresses family law procedures and issues related to conducting evaluations of children and their parents involved in disputed custody . chapter twelve traces the development and current applications of the concepts of criminal responsibility and legal insanity . chapter thirteen delineates the related nuances of criminal intent and diminished capacity . part four presents information on seven special applications of forensic psychology . chapter fourteen leads off with a discussion of violence risk research and assessment , and chapter fifteen follows with an overview of emerging roles for psychologists in law enforcement . chapter sixteen reviews considerations related to evaluating jury decision making and promoting juror competence . chapters seventeen and eighteen review developments related to the evaluation of testimony given by adults and children . on the whole , however , developments from the nineteen eighties forward are addressed in the works of other contributors to this handbook . legal psychology . legal psychology refers to psychological theory , research , and practice directly pertinent to the law and legal issues . do horses in the field stand with head or tail to the wind ? in which direction do the seeds of an apple point ? what was the weather one week ago today ? when mckeen cattell posed these questions to fifty six college students at columbia university in march eighteen ninety three , he was probably conducting one of the first american studies , albeit an informal one , on the psychology of testimony . the questions he asked his students were similar to those that might naturally be asked in a court of justice . as we will see shortly , both french and german psychologists were familiar with the powerful influence of suggestion over sensation and perception , having conducted substantial research in these areas . the specific conditions under which testimony was inaccurate were not known , however . cattell noted : an unscrupulous attorney can discredit the statements of a truthful witness by cunningly selected questions . first , alfred binet replicated cattell project in france . in addition , he summarized relevant experiments on the psychology of testimony that were being conducted in europe , and he eventually called for a science psychojudiciaire . stern and liszt conducted a reality experiment in a law class , staging a bogus quarrel between two students over a scientific controversy . as stern later recounted it , the argument accelerated until one student drew a revolver . at this point , the professor intervened and asked for written and oral reports from the class about aspects of the dispute . among the psychologists retained by the defense was julian varendonck , who designed a series of experiments based on questions suggested by information obtained at the preliminary hearing . varendonck subjects were children of approximately the same age as the two witnesses . in contrast , both binet and stern believed that errors in recollection , whether by children or adults , were more a reflection of leading , suggestive courtroom questioning than of any natural tendency to distort reality . in nineteen twelve , marbe became one of the earliest european psychologists to testify at a civil trial , offering expert opinion on the psychological issue of reaction times as applied to a train wreck near mullheim . as he did in the criminal case , marbe appears to take credit for paving the way for other psychologists : since that time , through my agency and that of others , a mass of psychological expert testimony has been submitted , bearing continually upon new circumstances . although mulberger wrote that other psychologists were testifying in civil courts even before marbe time , it is difficult to find written documentation of who they might have been . marbe , along with stern , has been credited with developing forensic psychology in germany . presumably , the slower the reaction time in recognizing the key words , the more likely the respondent was trying to deceive . barland , who has reviewed this history in impressive detail , notes that this approach did not catch on because it was inefficient , time consuming , and often yielded inconclusive results . at the turn of the twentieth century , american psychologists remained comparatively uninterested in applying research on topics related to law . one reason was that they were just beginning to explore the broad psychological landscape and had little inclination to specialize in law related matters . this reticence was probably also due to the influence of wilhelm wundt , who had trained many of the american pioneers in his leipzig laboratory . munsterberg spent twenty four years trying to persuade the public that psychology had something to offer virtually every area of human endeavor . his claims were often exaggerated , however , and his proposals were rarely empirically based . he usually published in popular magazines rather than in scholarly journals . he also incessantly promoted himself and his native germany , a practice that alienated him increasingly from his colleagues and the public as world war i approached . in fact , his ardent progerman stance may have had as much to do with the public antipathy toward him as his abrasive personality . in nineteen fourteen , munsterberg published a study on group decision making , using harvard and radcliffe students as subjects , which he titled the mind of the juryman . in a conclusion not atypical of the times , he stated that the psychologist has every reason to be satisfied with the jury system as long as the women are kept out of it . he based his conclusion on a finding that the female students in his study were less accurate in their final decisions than the male students . interestingly , as will be noted shortly , one of his own students later arrived at a very different conclusion . nonetheless , he undeniably pushed his reluctant american colleagues into the practical legal arena and made a seminal contribution to applied psychology in general and forensic psychology in particular . world war one placed in abeyance most of the exploration in applying psychology to law , although the war and early postwar years saw a few landmarks in american forensic psychology , including the gradual acceptance of psychologists as expert witnesses . the first psychologists , along with other social scientists , were also appointed to law school faculties during these years . psychologist donald slesinger , a protege of robert hutchins , made his mark during the years immediately following world war one . although he had no formal legal training , slesinger was appointed by acting dean hutchins as a one year sterling fellow to the yale law school in nineteen twenty seven . in fact , marston was the psychologist who testified in the landmark case frye , the case that set the original standard for the acceptance of expert testimony in federal courts . although his continuing work in lie detection represents one of his major contributions to the forensic area , it was by no means the only one . he frequently consulted with attorneys , police , and other criminal justice personnel , and his evidence was determinative in the acquittals of several defendants accused of murder . because of his legal background and his cautious style , marston ideas and research were more acceptable to the legal community than munsterberg had been , although there is little evidence that the legal system put his findings to extensive use . this is not surprising because some of his recommendations were inapposite to the adversarial process in the united states , and others would have required fundamental changes in court procedures . interestingly , the german psychologist stern , discussed earlier , had cautioned his colleagues that experimental research in psychology might be of more relevance to the inquisitorial process used in european courts , where a neutral jurist asked questions of witnesses , than to the adversarial process in the united states . also during this time period , various reviewers took on the task of documenting the progress of legal psychology . hutchins and slesinger , for example , coauthored numerous summary articles on its status . slesinger wrote another article with marion pilpel in nineteen twenty nine , surveying forty eight articles written by psychologists on issues relating to the law that had appeared in professional journals up to that time . eleven were concerned with the psychology of testimony , ten with deception , seven with intelligence and crime , and six with criminal behavior . the remainder focused on general topics such as the scientific method or legal research . fifteen of the forty eight articles had been written by german psychologists . like applied psychology in general , legal psychology was somewhat dormant between the two world wars and did not regain its energy until the late nineteen forties and nineteen fifties . in addition to marston work , the period did see scattered research on how juries formed opinions and verdicts , a master thesis on the relationship between narrative and interrogative methods of questioning , another study on questioning and testimony , and a survey of legal and psychological opinions about the validity of some of wigmore rules of evidence . according to loh , there was some interest in psychology and law during the late nineteen twenties and the nineteen thirties . in nineteen thirty one , psychologist harold burtt wrote legal psychology , possibly the first textbook in the area . disputing this claim , mulberger commented that the german psychologist otto lipmann had published a psychological textbook for jurists long before this . the truth may depend on the meaning of the word textbook . lipmann clearly deserves credit for his work , which was a compilation of the lectures he gave to students studying law . lipmann book was specifically intended to educate current and future judges and lawyers , whereas burtt book was intended for both lawyers and students of applied psychology . nevertheless , although burtt book made a valuable contribution to the academic psychological literature , it had little discernible influence on the legal profession or on applied psychology in general . in nineteen thirty five , edward robinson published law and the lawyers , which predicted that jurisprudence would become one of the family of social sciences and argued that all of its fundamental concepts must be brought into line with psychological knowledge . the book was lambasted by lawyers and essentially ignored by psychologists . in hindsight , later scholars found robinson ideas much more palatable . it is generally believed that american psychologists have served as expert witnesses since the early nineteen twenties , but , like their european counterparts , they consulted with lawyers and the courts , perhaps particularly the civil courts , before that time . included in this latter category are the juvenile courts , which were a hybrid of the civil and the criminal , dealing with matters of both child protection and delinquency . psychological consultation with juvenile courts was common from their inception in eighteen ninety nine . consultation with and testimony in criminal courts was much less common , as we discuss shortly . according to rogers , the results of experimental research on visual perception were routinely accepted in trademark infringement cases . in cocacola company cherocola company , for example , an experimental psychologist was asked whether the trademarks used by the two companies were so similar as to be likely to cause confusion in the public mind and ultimately deceive the consumer . this was apparently considered a safe undertaking , as the psychologists were not infringing on the territory of the medical experts physicians and psychiatrists who routinely testified on matters of criminal responsibility . often , however , it was where female psychologists were most accepted . in the nineteen thirties , for example , fewer than onethird of all american psychologists were women , but women made up over sixty percent of all applied psychologists . in one of the first published accounts of the work of these early psychometrists . keller described some of the challenges they faced . he noted that in december nineteen sixteen , a psychopathic laboratory was established at the new york city police department for the express purpose of examining persons detained before trial . the staff included psychiatrists , neurologists , social workers , and psychologists , whose task was to conduct hasty pretrial evaluations . according to keller , who was a consulting psychologist at the clinic , detainees arrived for testing at nine am  the disadvantage is the lack of time , for all prisoners must be examined in time to get them to court by noon or earlier , and many courts are situated in distant parts of the city . staff members had little time in which to conduct the evaluation and prepare a report that would help the court in its decision making . a student of noted psychologist stanley hall , goddard paved the way for the massive intelligence testing of immigrants and residents of mental institutions , prisons , and juvenile training schools . in volume one of the american psychologist , shartle described the work of a prison psychologist . administers intelligence , aptitude , and other tests to either all inmates or certain groups depending on institutional policy . writes an interpretation of test results for the prisoner records . gives information in consultation with administrative officers or with specialists in the field of medicine , psychiatry , sociology , education , occupational training , or parole . assists in planning or revising programs for medically sponsored cases including psychiatric and severe physical disability cases . until the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies , although there were exceptions , psychologists in correctional facilities focused more on classification than on treatment , although important treatment models were proposed by psychologists such as herbert quay and marguerite warren . nevertheless , treatment was not the predominant activity , both because the demand for diagnostic services was great and the obstacles relative to respecting confidentiality and achieving the trust of inmates were difficult to surmount . with the exception of psychologists in the federal bureau of prisons , psychologists working in american prisons reported organizational impediments to conducting meaningful assessments and offering meaningful treatment . in the nineteen sixties , rehabilitation as a correctional goal began to gain favor , and in some but certainly not all prison settings psychologists spent more time working directly with offenders and providing treatment services . police officers at all ranks scored below average on the army alpha ; in fact , the more experienced the police officer , the lower was his intelligence score . the average score for the three hundred and seven patrol officers was seventy one ; the sergeants averaged fifty four ; and the seventeen lieutenants , fifty seven . thurstone concluded that law enforcement did not attract intelligent individuals , and the more intelligent individuals who entered police service left for other occupations where their abilities and intelligence were better utilized . law enforcement officers were vindicated somewhat , however , when maude merrill administered the army alpha to a group of already employed officers and applicants . they scored at the average level . blackburn , in the first issue of legal and criminological psychology , asserted , the growth in the number of forensic psychologists has been among the most prominent developments in the burgeoning application of psychology to law during the last two decades . he noted that , although the growth was most apparent in the united states , there was a parallel growth throughout europe in the latter part of the twentieth century . all indicators suggest that forensic psychology has an extremely promising future as we continue into the twenty first century . in the following chapters , other contributors assess forensic psychology current status and the promise it holds for a future generation of researchers , practicing psychologists , theorists and legal practitioners . in the law , past cases and matters such as constitutional interpretation rather than innovation or creativity are painstakingly relied on for the development of legal arguments . the model adopted in law is one of legal precedent . in contrast , in psychology , the model is one of innovation , and psychologists , in both research and applied work , are encouraged continually to explore new ideas and methods . bias and self interest and advocacy are not only permitted but heralded as one of the strengths of the process . indeed , what is of immediate concern and the driving force for the opposing lawyers is victory . psychology , in contrast to law , attempts to arrive at truth using a variety of diverse data gathering methods . common to all of these methods is the systematic collection of data , using procedures that attempt to reduce bias , error and distortion in observation and inferences . at a macro level , forensic psychologists can assist the legal system in four ways : providing legal decision makers with information about complicated matters that they would not otherwise have , assisting specific legal actors , researching the legal system and its operation , and researching psychological phenomena that are of particular interest or relevance to the legal system . psychologists participation in this way is based on the premise that , in some cases , legal decision makers must consider complicated psychological matters that are beyond their understanding , and their judgments would benefit from the insights and opinions of someone with specialized knowledge about the matter , such as a psychologist . these activities are quite varied and range from involvement in criminal proceedings in which the competence of a defendant to stand trial is in dispute to civil proceedings in which the court is faced with making decisions about what type of living and legal arrangements would be in a child best interests in the case of divorcing parents who can not reach an agreement about these matters . a large body of research exists that establishes psychologists potential to assess law enforcement officers in matters of investigation and interrogation . once a crime is reported , law enforcement officials conduct an investigation to establish whether a crime has in fact been committed , whether it can be solved , and whether they can obtain evidence to facilitate a prosecution . to this end , it is important that attorneys conceptualize and explain the case in a way that the jury understands and that will best fit the verdict option that suits their clients . beyond assisting attorneys in conceptualizing the case and presenting information to jurors in the most compelling manner , psychologists may assist attorneys with jury selection . in the united states , the jury is selected in a process known as the voir dire , during which potential jurors are questioned by the judge or attorneys in order to ensure that a fair and impartial jury is empaneled . as such , jurors may be challenged for cause in cases where it is determined that a juror has preexisting beliefs that would prevent him or her from making a decision in the case based solely on the evidence presented . the use of mock juries involves bringing a group of jury eligible people together , presenting them with case information in order to determine how various arguments and presentations affect their thinking and decision making , and shaping the case presentation accordingly . parent coordinators typically are appointed only in the most challenging cases involving divorced parents who experience enduring high conflict surrounding the caretaking of their children . not surprisingly , the legal authority for parent coordinators , their rights , and their responsibilities varies across jurisdictions . recently , however , at least two organizations have provided important direction to psychologists serving in this role by publishing practice guidelines . indeed , all states in the united states have enacted crime victim legislation , most of which provides for funding of mental health treatment services . despite the stark reality of the large number of crime victims at any point in time , with the exception of work focusing on victims of interpersonal violence , rape and sexual assault , and child abuse , surprisingly little psychological research exists regarding the impact that offending has on victims more generally . that we know so little about the efficacy of interventions designed to assist victims responses to and manage adverse psychological outcomes is particularly surprising given the ubiquitousness of criminal victimization in our society . the pcc , which was developed by andrews and bonta in the nineteen eighties and refined over time , is a theory concerned with individual differences in criminal behavior , making it a particularly useful guide both for assessing the risk of recidivism and for planning rehabilitation attempts . the pcc provides directions for the assessment and treatment of offenders that are embodied in the principles of rnr . the risk principle directs that the degree of intensity of treatment programs for offenders must be matched to an offender level of risk . therefore , more intensive intervention is provided to those assessed as being a high risk for reoffending . conversely , lowerrisk offenders have been shown to derive better outcomes from a less intensive level of service and intervention . the needs principle posits that , to reduce recidivism , treatment must focus on the offender criminogenic needs . the responsivity principle considers factors that may affect or even impede an offender response to interventions . psychologists researching psychological matters of particular interest to the legal system . in addition to researching the legal system and its functioning , psychologists conduct research on a multitude of psychological factors or phenomena that are of particular interest to the legal system . some of these areas of inquiry are discussed next . some psychological phenomena are of particular interest to the legal system given their nature , and research psychologists have made considerable contributions in these areas . because identification of the accused by eyewitnesses is integral to many convictions , understanding how accurate eyewitnesses are and what factors may affect their recollections is highly important . as a final example , psychopathy defined as a constellation of affective , interpersonal and behavioral characteristics , including egocentricity , impulsivity , irresponsibility , shallow emotions , lack of empathy , guilt , or remorse ; pathological lying ; manipulativeness ; and the persistent violation of social norms and expectations is of particular interest to the legal system , given the high rates of persistent offending displayed by persons with this disorder . in addition , psychologists researching these matters have devoted considerable efforts to defining the nature of these capacities . when evaluating psycholegal capacities , psychologists employ a variety of tools and techniques , some of which are used in more traditional settings that psychologists work in and some of which have been developed for use in forensic settings . these assessment tasks are either descriptive or predictive . integral to understanding the potential value and accuracy of such evaluations is research that operationalizes these psycholegal capacities and examines the utility of various techniques and instruments that are designed to assess them . only if research findings indicating that psychologists have some special abilities in understanding these issues are psychologists justified as entering the courts as experts and the courts justified in hearing psychologists testimony . thus , psychologists conduct research examining the utility of various assessment tools and approaches that have been developed to describe psycholegal constructs or inform predictions of behaviors of interest . another common forensic evaluation task involves prediction . in his one thousand, nine hundred and eight treatise , on the witness stand , munsterberg discussed a variety of ways in which psychologists could contribute to legal proceedings , with chapters devoted to phenomena as varied as lie detection , eyewitness memory , false confessions , and crime prevention . as the information in this chapter shows , the roles that forensic psychologists play are broad and varied , with some areas being far more developed than others . as another example , a forensic practitioner must translate competence to stand trial into elements that can be assessed . additionally , although it is generally true that the law does not presume that any psychiatric diagnostic condition is synonymous with any legal incompetency , in some jurisdictions , the law specifies a direct link between a diagnostic condition and a legal outcome . a combination of nomothetic and idiographic data should be collected to assess clinical condition , functional abilities , and a causal connection between the two . the clinician formulation of the relevant forensic issues should inform his or her selection of appropriate forensic assessment instruments . moreover , even in jurisdictions that allow a forensic mental health professional to answer the ultimate legal issue , current best practice standards suggest that practitioners nonetheless refrain from offering ultimate issue testimony . as discussed later in this chapter , various laws are relevant to fmhas , which underscores the need for forensic mental health professionals to possess legal knowledge relevant to their practice . for example , a common mistake is to substitute a clinical diagnosis for a calculated analysis of a functional ability . notwithstanding the previously discussed atkins exception wherein a clinical diagnosis constitutes the ultimate legal issue , normative diagnostic testimony exclusively concerning a mental health disorder highlights grisso concerns relating to ignorance and irrelevance . fortunately , recent developments in the scientific approaches used to conduct fmhas and improvements in the law theoretically should reduce the incidence of insufficient and incredible testimony . however , testimony that relies on speculation and illsupported or novel theories is unfortunately not uncommon and is often presented in court as fact , which leads to confusion or mistaken beliefs among legal decision makers . all of these issues and concerns underscore the need for clinicians interested in conducting fmhas to possess an understanding of the law and the ability to appropriately apply such knowledge in forensic contexts . statutory law . when many people envision what a law looks like , they may imagine some code or subsection with a potentially long string of numbers . legislatures may also revise statutes in reaction to recent judicial decisions about how a statute is to be interpreted . the third major source of law is constitutions . constitutions provide specific rights and protections and are often the authority on which courts rely when invalidating a statute . in the united states , individuals are protected by both the us constitution and their individual state constitution . individuals are protected by constitutions , and the legislatures , courts , and executive agencies are bound by constitutions . moving from the general to the specific , legal treatises are entire books devoted to one area of law , which means they have much less breadth than legal encyclopedia but considerably more depth . hornbooks are a specific type of treatise . although hornbooks are traditionally written to help law students navigate through an unfamiliar area of the law , they are helpful for anyone new to a specific area . nutshells are another type of treatise , similarly devoted to one area of law , but with an emphasis on conciseness . because there are multiple sources of law , comprehensive legal research involves more than simply looking up the relevant guiding statute . researching beyond the statute for example , by looking at case law to see how courts have applied and interpreted the statute is particularly important if the statute has not been revised in many years or if there is reason to believe that it is no longer good law , which is a concept we discuss later in this chapter . using illegal drugs is typically a state offense . however , if someone commits a drug offense in yosemite national park , he or she would be prosecuted for that offense in federal court . as one last example , stealing a car is typically a state offense . if , however , that stolen car is subsequently driven across state lines , it would become a federal offense prosecuted in federal court . within the federal and state court systems , the courts are further subdivided into hierarchies or tiers . trial courts of general jurisdiction handle the vast majority of cases , both criminal and civil . a trial court purpose is to determine the facts of the case and settle the dispute . criminal trial courts apply penalties such as fines , judicially supervised release , incarceration , and death . in fact , several states lack the aforementioned intermediate appellate courts . in those states , an appeal granted after a trial court case would be heard directly by the state high court . in states with an intermediate appellate court , the high court would only hear a case that has been adjudicated at the trial level , answered on appeal at the intermediate level , and then appealed again to the state high court . as with the federal district courts , circuit court cases are presided over by a three judge panel . at the top tier of the federal court system is the us supreme court . the us supreme court is the highest court in the country , and being a frequent topic of discussion , it is often abbreviated as ussc or scotus . as an appellate court , the supreme court only hears cases for which the justices have granted an appeal . thus , whereas a writ of habeas corpus may arise after conviction , sentencing , and lengthy detainment , a writ of certiorari requests review of a decision recently rendered . also , whereas a writ of habeas corpus is applicable only in criminal contexts , a writ of certiorari applies in either civil or criminal contexts . one common misunderstanding is that individuals file writs of certiorari to the supreme court requesting that the court hear a particular case . another affordable electronic legal database is national law library . the federal law collection includes coverage of case law from the us supreme court and all federal circuit courts and coverage of federal rules , and the state law collection provides fifty years of case law coverage . for example , the law library of congress has a number of helpful tutorials and direct links to primary and secondary sources of law . to reduce costs associated with using subscription based commercial databases , one option is to begin researching a legal issue on google scholar and then move to a commercial database once the research has been sufficiently narrowed . although formal legal research using primary sources of law and commercial electronic legal databases , such as westlaw and lexisnexis , provide accurate and detailed information relevant to forensic mental health professionals , these options can be costly and difficult to access for some mental health practitioners . digests are organized alphabetically by subject , which generally benefits the forensic practitioner interested in researching a circumscribed number of specific legal issues , and they are available in versions that include state , federal , and us supreme court cases . law libraries provide comprehensive and varied source of legal resources , and occasionally they permit visitors to access their collections . moreover , law librarians can be a valuable resource in guiding a forensic clinician through the legal research process and suggesting relevant legal materials . forensic mental health professionals who do not reside near law libraries may nevertheless benefit from visiting public , university , or courthouse libraries . for example , the american academy of forensic psychology , which is the training and education affiliate of the american board of forensic psychology , sponsors a variety of ce workshops that focus at least in part on legal issues relevant to forensic practice . it is the combined facts and procedural history that can help inform readers about whether the case is relevant to their needs . stated another way , the facts tell whether two cases are alike or different in key elements , and the procedural history determines whether the case is binding or persuasive authority in a given jurisdiction . rather , an older decision or statute just means there is more time for potential history that needs review . the process of determining whether a law is good law has been described by many different names , including citechecking , verifying , confirming , and updating . by reading those cases it is possible to determine whether any major court cases have addressed the statute . the terms reversed and overruled sometimes are used interchangeably , but a good way to think of it is that holdings get reversed and legal rules get overruled . to determine whether a case is still good law , start by checking the case procedural history , which should be included at the end of the case . the case procedural history would show whether the case was appealed and whether that appeal was granted , and , if so , whether a higher court upheld or reversed the lower court decision . as another general rule , it is common to cite to the highest authority that heard a case . as discussed earlier , some authority is binding , and other authority is persuasive . whether an authority is good law or bad law partially depends on whether it is being relied upon as binding authority or persuasive authority . most challenging is when one or more courts in the same jurisdiction and at the same level have treated a case differently . although courts are free to reach different decisions , there is some pressure and expectation for different courts on the same level to adhere to stare decisis and rule similarly . unreasonable or intrusive demands may on occasion come from supervisors , employers , or organizations . as an example in a correctional setting , a prison psychologist was instructed to serve on disciplinary committees that were hearing his patients cases and deciding their punishments . by referring to his ethical obligation to avoid problematic multiple relationships and conflicts of interest , as elaborated in this chapter , the psychologist was able to clarify the impropriety of his serving on these committees and was excused from doing so . two other documents providing guidance in practicing principled forensic psychology are the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology and the guidelines for child custody evaluations in family law proceedings , both of which are modeled after the ethics code and are endorsed by the apa . psychologists should safeguard the rights and welfare of those to whom they provide services and maintain vigilance to ensure that their influence is not misused . they should strive to benefit those with whom they work and avoid doing harm , and they should recognize any adverse effect of their own physical and mental health on the services they provide . this respect should extend to persons with diverse backgrounds , including diversity related to age , gender , gender identity , race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sexual orientation , disability , and socioeconomic status . psychologists should neither condone nor participate in discriminatory practices based on such individual differences . when applied in individual cases , these principles overlap in many respects , and a case illustrating any one of these principles usually illustrates one or more other principles as well . similar overlap characterizes the ten standards in the ethics code discussed next . for extended discussion of how these principles and standards interrelate and how they should be applied in various contexts , readers are referred to contemporary texts by bersoff , kitchener and anderson , knapp and vandecreek , and koocher and keithspiegel . many psychologists viewed this provision as appearing to endorse the so called nuremberg plea that commission of evil acts was acceptable because i was following orders . the reviewer was aware that narrative statements in computerized test reports warrant forming hypotheses but not drawing definite conclusions , because they describe characteristics of people in general who have certain scores on a test and do not necessarily describe the person who was examined . as another possibility , should the reviewing psychologist , instead of or in addition to giving testimony , have brought the matter to the attention of the state board of psychology or the ethics committees of any professional organizations of which the examining psychologist was a member ? did the damage to the examining psychologist future credibility as an expert witness constitute a sufficient penalty for his misrepresentation , or should the involved parties have pressed for further sanctions , such as prosecution for perjury or actions against his license ? such matters of judgment commonly arise in forensic cases , despite the guidance of unambiguous principles , and equally principled psychologists might for various reasons answer the preceding questions in different ways . the standard on competence addresses psychologists obligations to provide services only within the boundaries of their abilities as gleaned from their education , training , study , relevant supervision , and professional experience . they can serve populations or employ methods unfamiliar to them only after sufficient preparation , consultation , and supervision to ensure professional competence . chapter twenty two in this volume by otto , kay , and hess emphasizes basing court related activities including consultations , administrative hearings , and depositions as well as appearances on the witness stand on as firm an empirical basis as possible . tensions nevertheless arise between what forensic psychologists know for sure and about what they are asked to opine , and discrete decisions must often be made in the absence of absolute certainty . in this vein , monahan and steadman advised mental health law specialists to model the way meteorologists announce a seventy percent change of rain , as by responding to a question about violence risk with a percentage estimate of its likelihood in a particular case . because competence is a critical consideration for forensic psychologists and one that often undergirds an ethics complaint or a lawsuit , the forensic specialty , child custody , parenting coordination , and child protection guidelines all pay considerable attention to it . as a stark example of expert testimony that was incompetent by virtue of inadequate foundation , golding described the testimony of james grigson , a psychiatrist , whose work formed the basis for the us supreme court analysis in barefoot estelle . in barefoot , for example , grigson testimony passed judicial review but not psychiatric peer review . an american psychiatric association amicus brief asserted that grigson should not have been permitted to testify in barefoot estelle because it is unethical for a psychologist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination . shuman and greenberg also decry instances in which courts accept expert testimony in custody cases from a psychologist who has examined only one parent and offers an opinion about which of two parents would better serve the needs of the child . aside from being patently unsound how can a comparative opinion be formed when only one parent has been seen ? this interesting question became moot , however , because the judge ruled the letter inadmissible due to the marital privilege even though the couple had divorced a year before the murders . the psychologist retained by the prosecutor testified that the defendant knew the nature and quality of the charges against him and was able to distinguish right from wrong because voices he claimed to hear were coming from inside and not outside his head . the second prong , which is an alternative statutory criterion for insanity in some but not all jurisdictions , is volitional in nature and speaks to a loss of behavioral control such that the accused was unable to alter or refrain from his or her criminal conduct at the time . in other situations , forensic psychologists may have to form their opinions with less certain criteria to draw on than are available when insanity is the issue . the ethics code standard on human relations speaks to practicing , teaching , and researching psychology in ways that are considerate of others and avoid causing them harm to the degree possible . the next case illustrates one examiner consideration in minimizing harm that might have resulted from his providing necessary information in open court . in the absence of such a signed release or legal requirement or permission , any disclosure of information is a violation of privacy rights . issues concerning the preservation of privacy have been complicated in contemporary times by technological advances in modes of information exchange . in a recent survey , mcminn , bearse , heyne , smithberger and erb found considerable uncertainty among several hundred psychologists regarding the ethicality of using certain communication technologies in professional practice . when they do advertise , forensic psychologists are likely to benefit most from presenting themselves in media to which attorneys attend , given that attorneys are commonly their major referral source . similar restraint should characterize any out of court statements by forensic psychologists about legal proceedings in which they are involved . these particular specialty guidelines overlap somewhat with the ethics code requirements concerning privacy , confidentiality , and privilege , and they also relate closely to the chapters in this volume on writing forensic reports and serving as an expert witness . also included in this section are considerations in determining appropriate inducements for research participants , whether and what types of deception are permissible , and the kinds of feedback that participants should be provided . likewise , have all of the participants in the research project whose assigned tasks will bring them into the prison been adequately prepared for being behind bars in the company of accused or convicted criminals ? these questions call for careful consideration of the circumstances in each instance , and there is no absolute or automatic answer that will inevitably be correct in every instance . in professional presentations as well as publications , psychologists are obliged to take reasonable steps to avoid factual errors and misleading or unwarranted statements . other sections of the standard concern such matters as the necessity of informed consent by persons being provided psychotherapy , considerations in offering or providing therapy for persons already receiving mental health services elsewhere , and issues related to the interruption or termination of an ongoing treatment relationship . the psychologist was employed by the department of corrections with duties that included providing psychotherapy as part of a prison based drug rehabilitation program for addicted inmates . during a psychotherapy session , an inmate mentioned in passing that he had fifty ccs of liquid cocaine stashed on the ward . the psychologist was aware that he was now faced with having to choose between maintaining prison security and preserving patient confidentiality . psychologists providing treatment for parents involved in custody disputes are also likely to face choices between reporting or withholding certain information , and they may at times have difficulty reconciling the specific ethical standard concerning privacy with the general principle of avoiding doing harm . some potentially difficult decisions are taken out of the psychologist hands by the law , as in the case of the requirement in all fifty states for professionals to report suspected child abuse . the nature and extent of this value based impact may not always be apparent , but being alert in every case to this possible threat to their integrity is no less important for forensic psychologists than being sufficiently competent to deal effectively with the substance of the case . in pursuit of this mission , he comes to believe that the father in every child custody case in which he consults should be awarded custody , and his reports always conclude that the father is the more suitable parent . this obvious intrusion of personal beliefs on professional conduct would have eroded the psychologist integrity , damaged the examinees , and undermined the legal process as well . forensic practitioners at times have to take responsibility for resisting attorney expectations and demands that reflect adversarial aspects of the judicial system and fall within the boundaries of the law but are not consistent with practicing principled forensic psychology . lawyers who try cases are accustomed to opposing each other , with a winner and a loser in each instance , and they are obliged to do whatever they can , within the rules of procedure and evidence , to win cases on behalf of their clients . when they are retained to evaluate an attorney client and provide expert testimony , their client is the attorney who retained them , not the person they are evaluating , and they have no responsibility for serving this person best interests or advocating on his or her behalf . the plaintiff in a personal injury case was seeking damages for allegedly experiencing an incapacitating stress disorder subsequent to being falsely accused of shoplifting in a department store . a psychological examination revealed few of the kinds of test patterns commonly found in persons with a stress disorder . concerning the potential for multiple relationships , attorneys may at times ask or expect practitioners to include therapeutic services in their work with a client they have referred for a forensic evaluation . at other times , an attorney may ask a client therapist if he or she would be willing to write an evaluation of the person for use in a forensic matter . the ethics code and the specialty guidelines urge practitioners to avoid such dual roles , out of concern that providing forensic and therapeutic services to the same or closely related individuals might impair their objectivity and risk doing harm to the recipient of their services . if asked to undertake concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services , forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider . attorneys may not know or be concerned about this practice constraint when they retain out of state experts , but licensing laws can pose serious obstacles to practicing outside of states in which one is licensed . it falls to forensic psychologists to take responsibility for learning about and complying with the local regulations whenever they practice across state lines , and these regulations vary from state to state . in exercising this freedom , practitioners do well to avoid cases in which their expertise might be misused to shore up a foolish , poorly conceived , or contrived defense . the other attorney wanted to pursue whether an innate sensitivity to threat might justify his client having beaten his brother in law to death , before the brother in law could beat him to death , without their being any evidence that the murdered man had acted aggressively or in a threatening manner toward the client . the psychologist felt strongly that participating in either a wandering eyes syndrome defense or an innate threat sensitivity defense would constitute misuse of his professional expertise and expose him to ridicule in his professional community . adhere to the ethics code in general , attend in particular to ethical principles and standards having specific implications for providing forensic services , and be familiar with the forensic specialty guidelines . offer services that reflect proficiency achieved through knowledge , skills , education , training and experience , and do not let this high level of competence erode over time . when confronting unfamiliar matters or an unexpected dilemma , consult with a respected colleague , and keep in mind that consulting relationships with attorneys can also provide helpful advice on the legal implications of certain forensic issues . parents often have a need to be heard , and focusing on the matters important to them during the first interview facilitates cooperation and participation . during the interviews , it is important for the evaluator to focus on each parent : concerns and allegations . responses to the allegations and concerns raised by the other parent . understanding of the child and his or her psychological , social , academic , and developmental functioning . description of the history of the relationship between the child and each parent . description of his or her own family history , especially focusing on relevant issues that may relate to the current evaluation . beliefs about the strengths and weaknesses of his or her own and the other parent parenting . description of the coparenting relationship and the ability of each parent to communicate with the other and make day to day decisions on behalf of the children . history of and ability to support the child relationship with the other parent and if there are concerns about this moving forward . understanding of the special issues in the case and how it may affect a parenting plan . recommendation for the specific parenting plan . for example , in a case with allegations of domestic violence , it is important to understand the parents description of the history of conflict resolution , whether there are issues of power and control , and the parents description of physical , verbal , and emotional abuse that may have occurred . if a parent describes physical violence , it is important to ask about the first , most recent , and worst incidents of abuse . it is always important to explore for more than what the parent initially describes , since many domestic violence victims are reluctant to share details of the abuse . in cases with allegations of alienation , it is important to explore each parent history of involvement with the child , each parent perception of his or her own and the other parent contribution to the child being alienated , and the extent to which the child is rigid in his or her rejection of one parent . the evaluator should explore whether the child has a realistic basis for being estranged from one parent or whether other dynamics are contributing to this alienation . finally , in relocation cases , in addition to best interests statutes , it is important to understand specific statutory or case law pertaining to relocation . in still other jurisdictions , every relocation matter is considered on a de novo basis . evaluators need to understand these statespecific legal issues in relocation matters . when interviewing parents in relocation cases , evaluators must : ask questions to understand the motives for relocation and the motives for opposing it . understand how each parent perceives the child will be affected by the move , both positively and negatively . collect family information to understand the social capital in each community . gather information from each parent about a proposed parenting plan should the court allow the move , or should the court not allow the move , or should both parents end up in the same location . interviews with the children . interviews with the children are a crucial part of understanding both the family dynamics and the relationship between the child and his or her parents . tell children that they do not have to answer questions they do not want to answer and that their parents or the judge will ultimately decide where and how they will spend time with their parents . evaluators must recognize that children language skills are not the same as adults . it is important to know that , although children often do not understand their questions , they may respond as if they do . it may be useful to ask children to repeat or to explain the questions to be sure that they understand them . how questions are asked affects the way answers are given . when interviewing children , particularly in a forensic context , it is vital to ask openended questions . these questions are far more likely to yield useful , accurate , and honest responses . asking leading or categorical questions limits the way that the child responds and , therefore , limits the usefulness and validity of those responses . it is important for the evaluation process to be balanced . as such , it is also important for children to be seen with each parent bringing them to the office . evaluators must keep in mind that one or both parents may influence their children . to reduce the risks associated with this influence , appointments should be scheduled equally with each parent bringing the children to the appointments . typical mood , and how the child typically expresses his or her feelings and if there is a difference for each parent . perceptions about the need to care for his or her parents emotionally . anything else the child wants the judge to know . these data provide important information to the court about the child life . because the evaluator is the only unbiased person providing information to the judge about the child , such information is vital to the court in helping it to make the ultimate decision about custody and parenting plans . observing parents and children together . in young children , the evaluator should observe the way children and parents relate with one another . do they play together , smile and laugh with one another , exchange affection with one another , or stay relatively distant and isolated from one another ? does the child seem attentive to the parent when the parent enters the room , or does the child seem disinterested ? when parents are in the room , it is important to listen to what they say . parents may want to talk about things that are inappropriate to discuss in front of the child , because they have a need to provide more information to the examiner . the observation session is not a good time for this so it is always important for evaluators to understand each parent ability to utilize adequate boundaries and keep the child free from anxiety . if the parent offers inappropriate comments in front of the child , the examiner should try to understand how the child feels about it , responds to it , and interacts with the parent about it . for example , some children get into arguments with their parents about things that parents say , and this provides valuable information about the interaction between parent and child . it is often helpful to provide tasks for the parent and child to complete . at the same time , the examiner must observe the affect of the parents and children . are they relaxed and having fun , or is there tension between the parent and child just as there is between the parents ? finally , with older children and their parents , it is important to talk about the routines , day to day life in each parent home , and how they and their parents deal with conflicts . examiners should pay particular attention to disparities between what the child says during individual interviews compared with the observation sessions . it is particularly important to explore a range of feelings between the child and parents in those families where alienation or estrangement is alleged . psychological testing and parenting questionnaires . if a psychologist quotes from a computer generated interpretive report , he or she should identify it as a quote and provide the citation . psychologists regularly administer psychological testing as part of a comprehensive , multimethod process of child custody evaluation . the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory two is the most commonly utilized psychological test administered to parents . other commonly administered psychological tests include the personality assessment inventory , the rorschach inkblot test , and the millon clinical multiaxial inventory . there is considerable controversy about using either the mcmiiii or rorschach in child custody work . examiners should be aware of the controversies and arguments on both sides of the issues when choosing to use those particular instruments , as presented in balanced reviews by craig , dyer , erard , and evans and schutz . finally , psychological test instruments should be used in a forensically informed manner . unlike the use of psychological tests in therapeutic settings , where the goal is to aid in diagnosis and treatment , tests in child custody and parenting evaluations should be informed by the forensic questions that guide the evaluation . questions pertaining to each parent general psychological and behavioral functioning , as it relates to their functional parenting and coparenting capacities , are common reasons for utilizing tests in parenting evaluations . the test data should be used to develop hypotheses about the parent psychological and behavioral functioning specifically in terms of how it relates to parenting and abilities to implement a parenting plan . it is also common to administer some type of parenting questionnaires or instruments to gauge a parent stress , measure each parent selfreport about his or her relationship with the child , and gather structured information about the child . it is important to recognize that these instruments are not definitive but also may provide useful hypotheses about the parents and their observations of their child . review of collateral information . collateral information falls within two major categories . first , the evaluator will review relevant pleadings , declarations , and other court documents that the attorneys submit . although these documents are not intended to bring truth to the case , they do provide a framework from which to understand each parent perspectives and concerns . evaluators must review all materials submitted , though the evaluator can set a deadline as to when materials must be submitted so the evaluation can be completed on time as required by the court . reviewing collateral information and talking with collateral sources allows for that . parents in the midst of a custody dispute tend to present themselves in the most favorable light and the other parent more negatively . collateral data can help balance this defensiveness and positive impression management by the parents . evaluators shall recognize the importance of securing information from collateral sources who , in the judgment of the evaluators , are likely to have access to salient and critical data . when assessing the reports of participants in the evaluation , evaluators shall seek from other sources information that may serve either to confirm or disconfirm participant reports on any salient issue , unless doing so is not feasible . in utilizing collateral sources , evaluators shall seek information that will facilitate the confirmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses under consideration . all collateral sources contacted shall be disclosed by the child custody evaluator . austin recommended that child custody evaluators use a concentric circle approach for gathering collateral data . these persons may have very critical information about a specific event that was witnessed but know absolutely nothing else about any of the family members . typically , the court order appointing a child custody evaluator allows the evaluator to speak with any thirdparty collateral sources chosen , even without the expressed permission of either parent . authorization from parents is required before speaking with professional collateral sources , such as teachers , therapists , and physicians . in any presentation of findings , the evaluator must : summarize the datagathering procedures , information sources , and time spent , and present all relevant information , including information that does not support the conclusions reached ; describe any limitations in the evaluation that result from unobtainable information , failure of a party to cooperate , or the circumstances of particular interviews ; only make a custody or visitation recommendation for a party who has been evaluated . this requirement does not preclude the evaluator from making an interim recommendation that is in the best interest of the child ; and provide clear , detailed recommendations that are consistent with the health , safety , welfare , and best interest of the child if making any recommendations to the court regarding a parenting plan . the specialty guidelines also instruct the forensic evaluator to disclose data and information that is not supportive of or contrary to the conclusions and recommendations offered by the evaluator . procedures . based on the need to demonstrate balance and neutrality and to help the court understand that the evaluation process was thorough , the evaluator must explain all procedures and describe the length of appointments and the place where interviews and observations occurred . materials reviewed must be described , and all collaterals who were interviewed must be listed . if certain procedures could not be completed , such as a stepparent who refused to be interviewed or a collateral witness who would not return phone calls , this should be described . the report should provide thorough and relevant information about each child . the examiner must keep in mind that this is likely to be the only opportunity the court will have to gain a truly objective perspective of the children and their adjustment . among other things , the data should include information about each child : developmental , social , psychological , academic , and social functioning , including interests , friendships , temperament and typical mood . relationship history with each parent . thoughts about each parent . feelings about a range of things , including the parents divorce and their behaviors as divorced parents . applying psychology to civil proceedings . exposure to parental conflicts , and the extent to which the child feels alienated or justifiably estranged from one parent , or the extent to which the child feels alienated or justifiably estranged from one parent . perspective of each parent caretaking and how each parent disciplines the child . a common complaint of parents is that the evaluator misrepresented what collateral informants offered . the analysis section is the most important component of the report . in cases involving claims of emotional distress , psychologists may be retained as experts , most often to evaluate the plaintiff and offer an opinion on the nature and extent of the psychological damage incurred by the plaintiff and the causal relationship between these injuries and the actions of the defendant . a tort is a civil wrong , but it is not necessarily an illegal act . sexual assault , for example , is both a crime and a possible basis for a tort action . in contrast , a person who slips on ice outside a neighbor front door and breaks a leg may be able to sue the neighbor for the harm suffered . although this may be morally reprehensible , the person could not be sued for failure to act . in a concise restatement of torts , the american law institute defines tortious conduct as including both acts of commission and acts of omission . for example , the owner of a day care center fails to properly screen potential employees and hires an individual who has a history of sexually abusing children , or a doctor fails to review a patient chart and prescribes a medication to which the patient is allergic . in both of these examples , the duty owed was not fulfilled . damage , which can include monetary losses , physical injuries , or emotional distress , is the third element of a tort . the patient , therefore , would have no cause for a tort action . the final element of a tort is causality , which requires that the damage incurred be directly related to the tortfeasor dereliction of duty . this concept is also known as proximate cause . the actions of the tortfeasor must be a primary reason or a substantial factor in bringing about the harm . in the previous example , suppose that , due to the physician error and the need to obtain an alternative medication , the patient was delayed for an extra thirty minutes at the pharmacy . intent means that the actor desired to cause the consequence of the act . sexual assault is an example of an intentional tort . a woman who sees someone lurking in her yard and points a gun at that person , in order to frighten him so that he will leave her yard , is acting with intent when the person runs away , because inducing fear was the intention of her act . if , however , the person runs into the street in front of a moving car and is killed , his death was not the intent of the actor , despite the ultimate outcome . negligence is defined as a departure from a standard of conduct demanded by the community for the protection of others against unreasonable risk . both acts of commission and acts of omission can be negligent . greenberg noted that , despite variations , most jurisdictions follow a similar pattern , which consists of several stages , including pleadings , discovery , trial , and judgment . at any stage of this process prior to a judgment being rendered , all or part of the case may be dismissed or the parties may agree to a settlement , thus ending the proceedings . the civil action begins when the plaintiff files a legal pleading known as the complaint , which outlines the grounds for the action and the events giving rise to the dispute . this phase allows the parties to obtain evidence and can be accomplished in a number of ways , including requests for the production of documents , the use of interrogatories , depositions , and physical or mental examinations of the plaintiff . this is the point at which forensic psychologists typically enter the process . if the plaintiff alleges that he or she incurred psychological damage or suffers from emotional distress as a result of the defendant actions , the defendant has the right to independently assess the nature and degree of psychological damage the plaintiff alleges . in civil litigation , the plaintiff has the burden of proof . this means the plaintiff is required to prove that it is more likely than not that the defendant actions resulted in damage to the plaintiff . this standard of proof is known as preponderance of the evidence . the plaintiff case is presented first . the attorney for the plaintiff will call and directly examine witnesses . during cross examination , leading questions may be asked , such as doctor , is not it true that no scale on the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory can prove that someone is responding truthfully on the test ? after the plaintiff case is concluded , the defense presents its case . witnesses will be called and directly examined , followed by cross examination by the plaintiff attorney . after both the plaintiff and the defendant arguments have been presented , the judgment phase begins . the trier of fact will consider the credibility of the evidence and render a verdict . in civil litigation , there are three considerations : did the defendant breach a duty that was owed to the plaintiff ? was the plaintiff injured by the actions of the defendant ? in the federal court system , the meaning of the term expert witness is defined in rule seven hundred and two of the federal rules of evidence as a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge , skill , experience , training , or education and can assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue using scientific , technical or other specialized knowledge . expert witnesses , unlike lay witnesses , may testify in the form of opinions and inferences if the testimony is based on sufficient facts and data ; the product of reliable methods and principles ; and if the underlying methods and principles have been applied reliably to the facts of the case . if the examiner opinion appears to support the plaintiff position , however , he or she will be asked to write a report and will be disclosed as an expert . as noted previously , rule thirty five of the frcp provides that the defendant can force the plaintiff to undergo an examination when the plaintiff claims psychological injury as a basis for receiving damages . in such cases , the plaintiff is entitled to receive a written report describing the examiner findings . unlike the ethical standards of the eppcc , which mandate behavior , the sgfp are aspirational and were designed to improve the quality of forensic psychological services ; enhance the practice and facilitate the systematic development of forensic psychology ; encourage a high level of quality in professional practice ; and encourage forensic practitioners to acknowledge and respect the rights of those they serve . specific issues that are likely to arise for psychologists performing personal injury evaluations are discussed next . a more detailed discussion of ethical considerations in forensic practice can be found in weiner and hess . by following a preestablished protocol , the psychologist is more likely to avoid bias in test selection , the scope or length of the interview , and decisions about including collateral sources . objectivity is also enhanced by a methodical approach to data interpretation characterized by identifying and testing alternative hypotheses , acknowledging and considering inconsistencies in the data , and avoiding selectively attending to data that support the evaluator opinion while ignoring or minimizing conflicting data . roles and role conflict . the attorney job is to persuade the trier of fact to find in favor of the party the attorney represents . this creates a conflict for the forensic evaluator , who must balance the demands of the advocacy based legal system with psychological ethics that require impartiality and not partisanship . the fact that the attorney is paying the expert and may hold out the promise of future work has the potential to further cloud these issues . the roles a psychologist can play in a personal injury evaluation are not limited to fact witness and expert witness . a psychologist might be retained as a consultant by an attorney . consultants do not evaluate the plaintiff or offer expert testimony . psychologists will find it easier to navigate these influences if they avoid multiple roles and remain focused on reaching opinions based on an unbiased and objective view of the evidence . once such opinions are reached , the psychologist can vigorously and persuasively advocate for his or her opinions , keeping in mind the distinction between advocating for an opinion and advocating for a party . in circumstances when such cross validation is not possible , resulting limitations should be identified . if the psychologist is not able to obtain sufficient data to reach an opinion on a given question , no opinion should be offered . it is also important to focus on collecting data that are relevant to the legal question at hand . relevant , in this context , is defined as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence . only relevant evidence can be admitted . forensic practitioners do not , by either commission or omission , participate in the misrepresentation of their evidence , nor do they participate in partisan attempts to avoid , deny or subvert the presentation of evidence contrary to their own position or opinion . as noted earlier , attorneys are obligated to vigorously advocate for the parties they represent . as such , attorneys attempt to present evidence in a light most favorable to their clients positions . by extrapolation , this definition suggests that psychological damage has two elements : that there is a change in the plaintiff emotional functioning , and that this change can be attributed , at least in part , to the actions of another party . emotional functioning . it is important to point out that the term psychological damage is not synonymous with psychiatric diagnosis . greenberg warned that substituting diagnosis for an analysis of functioning can be misleading , does not serve the purposes of the court , and has the potential to distort an objective assessment of the plaintiff . they noted that tort cases require a functional analysis of the plaintiff in order to understand how , if at all , the defendant actions have affected the plaintiff life . other conditions , such as depression and panic disorder , can be triggered by a traumatic experience , such as the death of a loved one , but they often arise in the absence of exogenous factors . in terms of personal injury evaluations , forensic experts are more likely to be presented with a diagnosis of ptsd than asd , as the symptoms of asd , according to the diagnostic criteria , resolve within a fourweek period . if the symptoms persist beyond this period , a diagnosis of ptsd would be considered . after four months , the man was called into his boss office without warning and fired . he was escorted to his office by security , allowed a few minutes to collect his personal belongings , and then escorted out of the building . both of these scenarios describe disturbing events that would be profoundly upsetting to most people . there is , however , a qualitative difference between the circumstances of scenario one and those of scenario two . the events described in the first scenario are consistent with the type of trauma outlined in criterion a , whereas the events described in the second scenario do not meet this criterion , as they do not involve actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the integrity of self . brunello estimated that onethird of the population will be exposed to a trauma of this magnitude at some point in their lives , yet only ten percent to twenty percent will develop ptsd . ptsd is twice as common among women as among men . the traumas most commonly associated with ptsd are combat exposure among men and rape and sexual molestation among women . in the general population in the united states , the prevalence of ptsd has been estimated at eight percent . in addition to meeting the bar set by criterion a , a diagnosis of ptsd requires the presence of additional symptoms described in criteria b through f . however , as many as ten percent of those who do develop ptsd remain chronically distressed . the second element in the legal definition of harm is causality the attribution of changes in the plaintiff condition to a specific event . koch noted that it is not necessary to prove that an event in question is the sole cause of the plaintiff psychological injury , but it does have to be a contributing cause . consider the following example . the plaintiff , a twenty eightyearold woman , was in a car accident in which two people died . the validity of competency judgments is difficult to assess because of the criterion problem . criterion related validity typically is assessed by examining concurrent validity and predictive validity . predictive validity is impossible to assess fully in the competency arena , because only defendants who are considered competent are allowed to proceed . not necessarily , because courts often accept the evaluator definition of competency and his or her conclusions without review , leading to very high levels of examiner judge agreement an issue that has been acknowledged for quite some time . roesch and golding argued that the only ultimate way of assessing the validity of decisions about incompetency is to allow defendants who are believed to be incompetent to proceed with a trial anyway . this could be a provisional trial in which assessment of a defendant competence related abilities could continue . as in the case of psychosis , a defendant with amnesia is not per se incompetent to stand trial , as has been held in a number of cases . in missouri davis , the defendant had memory problems due to brain damage . nevertheless , the missouri supreme court held that amnesia alone was not a sufficient reason to bar the trial of an otherwise competent defendant . in montana austad , the court held that the bulk of the evidence against the defendant was physical and not affected by amnesia . thus , it may be that the same defendant is competent for one type of legal proceeding but not for another . in certain cases , a defendant may be required to testify . in this instance , a defendant who is likely to withdraw in a catatoniclike state may be incompetent to proceed ; however , the same defendant may be able to proceed if the attorney intends to enter a plea bargain . if there is any substantial possibility that the accused could , but for his amnesia , establish an alibi or other defense , it should be presumed that he would have been able to do so . any other facts and circumstances which would indicate whether or not the defendant had a fair trial . one could substitute any symptom for amnesia in the quote from wilson . utah statute goes the farthest in this regard , specifying the most comprehensive range of psycholegal abilities to be addressed by evaluators and also requiring judges to specify which psycholegal abilities are impaired when a defendant is found incompetent . the assessment of competency requires consideration of both mental status and psycholegal abilities . specifically , the tool focuses on defendants knowledge of legal issues to the exclusion of other factors , and its scoring method has been criticized because of its idealized perception of the criminal justice system ; certain responses actually may reflect a sense of powerlessness in controlling one outcome in the legal system and may be based on past experiences with that system . the cst has been examined in a number of studies . at this point , it is not recommended for use as the sole method of screening defendants . competency assessment instrument . the most important measure developed by mcgarry , the competency assessment instrument , comprises thirteen items related to legal issues . unfortunately , few studies report either reliability or validity data . roesch and golding examined the utility of the cai by comparing thirty interviews conducted by pairs of interviewers who both used the tool ; item percentage agreements ranged from sixty eight percent to ninety six percent , with a median of eighty one percent . the interviewers were in agreement on the competency status of twenty nine of the thirty defendants . the interviewers decisions were in concordance with the more lengthy hospital evaluation decisions in twenty seven of thirty cases , or ninety percent . the original ifi comprised three major sections : legal issues , psychopathological issues , and overall evaluation . the three items in the consensual judgment section reflect postassessment resolution of differences between judges . the ifi has been revised to reflect changes in constitutional law and the adoption by many states of articulated competency standards . golding used the ifi in a study of pretrial defendants in the boston area who were referred by court clinics to a state mental hospital for competency evaluation . teams composed of a lawyer and either a psychologist or a social worker interviewed defendants . although the interviews were conducted jointly , each evaluator independently completed the ifi rating form . the results demonstrated that lawyers and mental health evaluators could make reliable competency judgments together . the fitr takes approximately thirty minutes to administer and consists of a structured interview that addresses three main areas : ability to understand the nature or object of the proceedings , or factual knowledge of criminal procedure ; ability to understand the possible consequences of the proceedings , or the appreciation of personal involvement in and importance of the proceedings ; and ability to communicate with counsel or to participate in the defense . each of these three sections is broken down into specific questions that tap into different areas involved in fitness to stand trial . these falsepositive errors were expected , as screening instruments should overestimate the rate of unfitness without making any falsenegative errors . there was one hundred percent agreement between the fitr and the institutionbased assessment for those individuals deemed fit to stand trial . research also has indicated that the fitr has adequate psychometric properties . boddy , roesch , zapf , and eaves compared defendants who were referred for fitness evaluations , including those who were eventually found unfit , and defendants who were not referred . performance on the fitr effectively distinguished these groups , such that referred defendants demonstrated significantly more impairment . as additional evidence of the construct validity of the fitr , zapf and roesch found reasonably high agreement between judgments made using the fitr and defendant performance on the macarthur competency assessment tool criminal adjudication . the fitr has also been used in research with young offenders . these researchers indicated that a twofactor solution may be more appropriate for defendants who have been adjudicated incompetent and who are undergoing inpatient treatment to restore competence . the major drawback of the gcctmsh is that it focuses on foundational competencies and generally ignores the more important decisional competencies stressed in the ifi and fit approaches . macarthur competence assessment tool criminal adjudication . for each item , the defendant is asked a question related to the vignette and is awarded two points if he or she is able to answer the question in a manner that demonstrates full understanding . if the defendant earns fewer than two points , the examiner discloses the answer and asks the defendant to repeat the disclosure in his or her own words . the purpose of the disclosure is to independently assess the defendant capacity to understand and his or her actual or preexisting understanding . thus , the scores obtained must be interpreted within the context of the specific defendant case and integrated with all the other clinically relevant factors that may surround the specific circumstances of the case . the psychometric properties of the maccatca were examined based on a sample of seven hundred and twenty nine felony defendants in eight different states . the results indicated that the maccatca demonstrated high levels of reliability . three of these scales were designed to tap into the three dusky prongs : consult with counsel , factual understanding of the courtroom proceedings , and rational understanding of the courtroom proceedings . the fourth scale , atypical presentation , is a response style measure consisting of five subscales : realistic , psychotic , nonpsychotic , impairment and both . in recent years , attention has been paid to two specific populations for whom issues of competency are especially important for various reasons juveniles and individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities or mental retardation . that is , a considerable number of defendants diagnosed with mr are not referred for psychological evaluations , and a general failure to recognize the magnitude and existence of the disabilities of such individuals is a major cause of the low rate of referrals , magnitude or existence of the disabilities of such individuals is a major cause of the low rate of referrals . although the under identification hypothesis is widely accepted among researchers and scholars , there are few empirical data to support it . it is common for these individuals to proceed to trial without ever having been identified and , consequently , to proceed through the criminal justice system without understanding the process or punishment , often unknowingly participating in agreements that can result in grave and longlasting consequences . the misidentification of individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities can result in a loss of liberty and the violation of the right to a fair trial . in a nineteen ninety four study of two hundred and seventy one defendants diagnosed with mr and committed to a special competence restoration program , individuals with higher iqs were more likely to be found competent or restored to competence . in addition , the author concluded that the absence of comorbidity was associated with restorability , as only three percent of those with comorbid disorders were restored to competence as compared to approximately twenty percent of those without comorbid disorders . in addition , comparisons of juveniles competence related abilities with those of adults has been the focus of much research and scholarly writing , and numerous studies have found age and competency to be negatively correlated , such that younger children are more likely to be found incompetent . as the focus of this chapter is on competency to stand trial in adults , the reader is referred to additional sources for more indepth information related to juvenile competency . specialized measures of competency . section two , skills to assist defense , is comprised of fifteen multiple choice items that address the attorney client relationship . items on sections i and ii are scored as either correct or incorrect . understanding case events , consists of ten openended questions designed to assess the defendant ability to describe the relevant circumstances of his or her offense . items are scored as one point , one point , or zero points based on the ability of the individual to relay information regarding his or her case in an accurate and understandable manner . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . the castmr was developed to assist in the determination of the competency of a defendant diagnosed with the authors of the castmr emphasized its use as only one component of an overall assessment . results of the castmr should be considered in the context of other relevant information , such as interviews , observations , and social history . the jaci covers twelve primary areas of evaluation . the macarthur judgment evaluation was developed for use in the assessment of immaturity of judgment in juveniles . similar to the maccatca , the macjen utilizes a vignettebased procedure to address three types of legal decisions typically involved in the criminal process : responding to police interrogations after the commission of a crime , disclosing information to one defense attorney , and responding to a plea agreement and testifying against other defendants . similarly , police reports of the alleged offense are necessary and a criminal history record is helpful , particularly if the defendant has cycled through the criminal justice and mental health systems several times . if the defendant is an inpatient , institutional records and progress notes should be reviewed as well as all available psychological test data . the possibility of recording the interview should be considered . the examiner should be aware of any aspects of the interview and the resulting report that are covered by statute or accepted practice within the jurisdiction . as an example of the former , some states require notifications that inform the defendant of the limitations of confidentiality that may apply . similarly , other states dictate the form of the report to the court , and an examiner report may be excluded if it does not comply with the required format . in people harris , for example , a psychiatrist report was excluded , and the defendant subsequent conviction was reversed because the opinion was presented in conclusory terms and failed to provide the clinical facts and reasons upon which it was based , thus precluding the trier of fact from independently assessing the weight to be given such an opinion . for example , per estelle smith , it is clearly prohibited to introduce material obtained under courtordered competency proceedings at a critical stage of trial . the trier of fact is required to separate these issues ; however , it is virtually impossible to do so when the reports are combined . a defendant who is clearly psychotic and legally insane at the time of an assault may respond rapidly to treatment upon arrest and be nonpsychotic and legally fit when actually examined . caution and fairness dictate keeping the reports separate when possible so that the courts can consider the two issues independently . this chapter touches on only a small selection of the vast amount of research and writing on competence to stand trial . the purpose of this chapter was to provide the reader with a brief overview of competency law , research , and assessment . finally , zapf and roesch presented a full consideration of best practices in the evaluation of competency to stand trial . these references as well as those listed in the introductory paragraph of this chapter will provide the reader with a more indepth understanding of competency to stand trial . the complexity of arguments , philosophical debates , opinions , and data on the insanity defense can not be approached without a personal decision to accept or reject a rather simple thesis . belief in this basic thesis is not subject to scientific argument ; rather , it is morally axiomatic . that is , one either accepts it as a function of one fundamental moral , religious , and jurisprudential presuppositions , or one does not . given the nonprovable nature of this moral thesis , scientific and logical arguments about aspects of the insanity defense and the assessment of mental state are possible , but acceptance or rejection of the argument is not a matter of proof or science . this fundamental belief may be stated in this way : in cognizing and regulating social interactions in terms of fundamental principles of fairness and justice , we assume that all such social interactions , including the societal judgment of criminal or civil responsibility for certain classes of proscribed behavior , are based upon an ethical calculus that assigns individual blame , culpability , liability , punishability , and moral and criminal responsibility as a function of intentionality and mental capacity . our belief , along with many scholars who have examined this issue , is that its existence is integral to the fabric of our social structure , which includes , but is not limited to , the structure of our criminal law . rather , we outline issues relevant to mental health professionals who are called on to evaluate defendants and offer expert opinions on the issue of criminal responsibility . concept of mens rea . it is well established within the historical and jurisprudential literatures that the fundamental concept of mens rea within judeochristian cultures has been in existence since the earliest recordings of hebrew law . is that furiosus furore solum punitur . in criminal cases therefore idiots and lunatics are not chargeable for their own acts , if committed when under these incapacities : no , not even for treason itself . one can show that the entire structure of the criminal law is built on this principle . sayre observed that , whereas one of the earliest legal texts , leges henrici primi , alternated between advocating absolute liability he who commits evil unknowingly must pay for it knowingly and advocating the principle of mens rea , it was standard practice for the king to either pardon mentally disordered persons found guilty of absolute liability crimes or for other financial arrangements to be made . the most comprehensive scholarly review of this narrowing approach was conducted by wales , who discussed the problem using the well known metaphor of squeezing a lemon . in other words , the prototypic case envisioned as qualifying for exculpation under the narrow view would be delusional mistake of fact . in discussing the legislative history of narrowing attempts , wales made it clear that the underlying motivation is to eliminate the insanity defense without raising constitutional considerations and to ensure that more insanity like acquittees are first found guilty and then found to be in need of treatment or mentally ill . beginning with the first nixon administration , there have been many attempts by federal and state legislatures to accomplish this shift in the focus of the insanity defense . in addition to the narrowing of the concept of mens rea , some states have experimented with giving decision makers an in between verdict , namely guilty but mentally ill , which , in reality , is simply a guilty verdict made without the guarantee of differences in sentencing , disposition , or mental health treatment . currently , the modal insanity defense criteria in those forty six states that recognize some version of the insanity defense involve either assessing criminal responsibility three hundred and nineteen the traditional american law institute formulation or restricted versions of the traditional naghten test . evolution of legal standards for criminal responsibility . although the naghten rules were rapidly adopted in the united states , they were almost immediately subjected to challenge on the narrowness ground and were modified significantly by some jurisdictions . in eighteen forty four , chief justice shaw of the massachusetts supreme court held that , although the right wrong test was proper , a defendant who acted under the influence of an irresistible impulse was not a free agent and , hence , was included under the rule , because he or she could not know right from wrong . as such , he discarded formal rules of specific states of mind and asserted that it was up to the trier of fact to decide if was the offspring or product of mental disease in the defendant , he was not guilty by reason of insanity . in fact , for a long period of time following naghten , there was considerable controversy over insanity rules that surfaced repeatedly . charles guiteau assassination of president garfield in eighteen eighty one gave rise to a highly controversial trial and execution that took place against the background of a strong concern over irresistible impulses and a belief that insanity , especially moral insanity , was all too easy to feign . whatever the jury may have thought of the battle of the experts and the problems of the insanity defense , however , guiteau placed himself in fatal jeopardy when he exhibited his uncontested egocentrism and interrupted the prosecutor toward the close of the trial by saying that is not the issue . the issue is , was my free agency destroyed ? i was overpowered . that is what the jury is to pass on . his rational comments may have prompted the jury to focus on his current mental state , a problem often confronted by defendants offering an insanity defense . in united states brawner , which ended the dc court of appeal experiments with the durham product test and adopted the model penal code recommendations of the american law institute , judge leventhal carefully reviewed the court logic in adopting durham . first , fruitful , accurate and considered reflection of the sensibilities of the community as revised and expanded in the light of continued study of abnormal human behavior . as a result , the majority in brawner adopted the ali rule and further encouraged judges to adopt instructions that emphasized the importance of nonconclusory testimony and the expert role as explaining to the jury the relationship between the defendant cognitive , behavioral , and affective functioning and his or her substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law . judge bazelon , in his partial dissent , agreed that the product test needed to be rejected , but he was more pessimistic , viewing the majority adoption of the ali rule as a change that was primarily one of form rather than of substance . judge bazelon argued that this justly responsible test has the virtue of making overt the underlying moral nature of the insanity defense and placing the hot potato aspect of such judgments squarely into the hands of the jury , as representatives of the community . the ali test in its full form has been adopted only by a few states hawaii , kentucky , massachusetts , rhode island , and wisconsin although a number of other states arkansas , connecticut , maryland , michigan , oregon , vermont , west virginia , and wyoming have adopted a modified version of the ali standard . although the full or modified ali rule has been widely adopted in federal jurisdictions and many states , the movement to reform the insanity defense and limit its perceived abuse has led to an attempt to eliminate the volitional prong of the test . following hinckley attempted assassination of president reagan , the stage was set for other states to pass gbmi legislation in response to the perceived abuses of the insanity defense . the current gbmi defense was not intended to replace the ngri defense . whereas both verdicts were introduced to stem the perceived tide of violence committed by offenders who escape justice , the current form was aimed primarily at jurors , with the hope that it would provide them with a middleground decision between guilty and ngri . the evaluation process generally includes three major components or sources from which to elicit data : an interview with the defendant ; traditional and forensic assessment instruments ; traditional or forensic assessment instruments ; and third party information , including but not limited to collateral reports , witness statements , victim statements , police reports , and records of various sorts . each of these three major sources of data is reviewed next ; however , the reader is referred to additional sources for more comprehensive and detailed information about the assessment process . in most jurisdictions , once defendants have entered their mental state into the adjudication process by interposing an insanity defense or some other mental state claim , no information revealed to the examiner that can be construed as relevant to that claim is protected . jurisdictions differ widely , however , as to whether indirect fruits of such evidence are admissible ; hence , extreme caution is required when preparing a report . the broadest coverage is found in the federal courts : no statement made by a defendant in the course of any examination . typically , it is difficult to separate these concepts , because a disturbed defendant usually will be treated with rapidly acting psychotropic medications . nevertheless , it is crucial to bear in mind that these mental states , although related , are separable , albeit with great difficulty . forensic evaluators need to be concerned with riggins factors , that is , alternations in the individual mental state as a function of psychotropic medication . we advise the use of sections of structured and semi structured interviews to cover the domain of psychopathology in a relatively standardized fashion to improve interexaminer reliability in the elicitation and coding of information . the detailed inquiry with respect to the defendant mso must also focus on the relationship of the psychopathological elements to the criminal conduct charged . as emphasized by many advocates and critics of the role of the forensic examiner in the legal process , the role of the expert is not to present legal conclusions or formal psychopathological diagnoses . rather , the role of examiner , as expert , is to import state of the art scientific knowledge about the existence of various psychiatric conditions and their relationship to behavioral , perceptual , cognitive , and judgmental capacities into the legal decisional process , the moral decisional process . it assists the trier of fact if the nature of these disagreements , as well as areas of agreement , are drawn as precisely as possible , with each examiner fully aware and able to comment in advance as to the reasons for disagreement . such pretestimony consultations also tend to produce higherquality and more informative strategies for direct and crossexamination . forensic assessment instruments . in addition , the mse can also be used to identify those individuals who are obviously insane and therefore do not require a more comprehensive evaluation . the mse is composed of three sections : historical information , which assesses a defendant premorbid psychological and cognitive functioning ; offense information , which accumulates information regarding the offense from the defendant and external sources ; and present mental status examination . compared to the evaluation team decisions , the trainees decisions had less agreement with the court verdict . of the ten defendants for whom the evaluation team suspected some significant mental abnormality , one was convicted , seven had their charges nolle prossed , and two were found insane . of the twenty defendants whom the trainees suspected had some significant mental abnormality , six were convicted as charged , four were convicted of a lesser charge , six had charges nolle prossed , and two were found insane . based on a comprehensive evaluation , the examiner rates the defendant with respect to a series of scales grouped into five areas : reliability of report , organicity , psychopathology , cognitive control , and behavioral control . for example , the psychopathology section involves ratings of bizarre behavior , anxiety , amnesia , delusions , hallucinations , depressed or elevated mood , verbal coherence , and affective and thought disorder . there is much reason to believe that forensic examiners reach their generally high level of agreement in ultimate opinions by different logical and empirically sustainable routes . the critical issue remains the association between organic or psychopathological disturbance and control judgment capacities , disturbance and moral judgement capacities ; these devices are most useful when they serve the heuristic value of highlighting the aspects of the defendant psychological state that are relevant , describing a purported relationship to control and judgment capacities , and organizing known data about the empirical relationships between disorder and psychological capacities in various states and situations . in contested cases , forensic examiners are particularly apt to encounter defendants with extreme or idiosyncratic beliefs about religion , politics , or personal identity , and questions regarding the delusional basis for those beliefs will arise . delusionality also enters the adjudicatory process when the issues of intentionality , compulsion , or the reasonableness of the defendant conduct may be related to a delusion . finally , delusionality is an important aspect of risk assessment with respect to release decisions . although there are surprisingly few studies on the frequency and nature of delusions of ngri defendants , indirect data , as well as experience , suggest that delusionality is a vital issue . delusions are prevalent among individuals with psychotic disorders . furthermore , roughly half of defendants who raise the insanity defense and seventy percent of insanity acquittees have psychotic diagnoses . defining and conceptualizing delusions . in the text revision of the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , a delusion is defined as : a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary . the belief is not one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person culture or subculture . like delusional beliefs , nondelusional but highly valued beliefs are often held with great zeal and intensity , even in the face of contradictory evidence . moreover , many persons shift between periods in which they experience certainty about their delusions and periods in which they demonstrate partial or full insight . these difficulties are frequently compounded by ambiguity surrounding the presence or absence of cultural support for the person belief . primary delusions are unmediated by thought , analysis , deduction , or reflection , whereas overvalued ideas and secondary delusions reflect varying degrees of cognitive appraisal and inference . primary delusions reflect a distinctive change in an individual personality functioning ; that is , they are a distinct change in the totality of the individual personal meanings and ways of construing the world . an overvalued idea is an understandable product of cognitive interpretation and can be viewed in terms of an individual personality , life experiences , and sociocultural background . a comparison of data on the rates and success of insanity pleas and the nature of insanity dispositions with data on public perceptions about these issues clearly reveals that the public overestimates the frequency and successfulness of the insanity plea and underestimates the nature and length of institutionalization following an insanity acquittal . in a similar regard , in foster state , the georgia supreme court unanimously reversed a murder conviction because the trial court did not define mentally ill and mentally retarded for the jury . the court held that , by not being provided with these definitions , the jury was unable to make an adequate assessment of the conditions and therefore could not properly consider potential verdicts . contrary to strong public concerns , ngri acquittees are not easily released . that is , unless patients perceive a subjective benefit from treatment , they are less likely to tolerate unpleasant side effects . mental health professionals who establish an authoritarian or paternalistic as opposed to a collaborative approach are also more likely to contribute to nonadherence . furthermore , as illustrated in jones and foucha , the person can be committed and held for what amounts to an indeterminant length of time . stredny , parker , and dibble examined the characteristics of recently hospitalized insanity acquittees in virginia and found that individuals diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders were less likely to receive recommendations for inpatient commitment than those diagnosed with psychotic disorders . specifically , those with higher levels of psychopathy and those who engaged in criminal behavior at a younger age were less likely to be recommended for release . research in the area of criminal responsibility has taken a number of forms . although the flurry of foundational risk relevant legal activity waned to some extent in north america throughout the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties , if one looks globally , there is no shortage of the enshrinement of risk within law and policy . this chapter addresses violence risk assessments , historically referred to as assessments of dangerousness , concerning mentally or personality disordered individuals possibly at risk for violence in the community . first , we review some of the landmark commentary , case law , and research that spurred the proliferation of risk assessment research and professional activity . then we consider major research studies published in recent years to evaluate the current state of research findings concerning violence risk assessments . the most widely cited study for the often stated proposition that predictions of violence by mental health professionals are wrong at least two times out of three , even when based on a known history of violence and extensive clinical examinations , is a study by kozol , boucher and garofalo . however , for the reasons that follow , neither should it be concluded from this study that predictions of violence by mental health professionals are wrong at least two thirds of the time . to begin with , kozol , boucher , and garofalo reported subsequently that at least fourteen of their forty nine patients classified as dangerous and yet released were patients who had been committed and studied during the early years of their program and who would not have been considered to be dangerous in the later years of their study . thus , if a patient deemed by a clinician to be too dangerous to be recommended for release is nevertheless released and does not recidivate , it is incorrect to conclude that the clinician made an inaccurate prediction . to the contrary , although the clinician may have concluded that the risk of causing harm still posed by the patient was too great to recommend the patient for release , the clinician may also have concluded that the patient might well not recidivate . this fact poses serious difficulties for attempts to evaluate the validity of clinical assessments of dangerousness or the relative merits of clinical versus actuarial assessments . indeed , litwack described a representative sample of patients confined on the grounds of dangerousness in a secure forensic facility and compared his sample to thornberry and jacoby sample . although unstructured clinical prediction still may be the most common approach to risk assessment , generally , as described here , it is not a model of risk assessment per se . research on actuarial risk assessment was spurred by these dismal conclusions . and , in part , spj arose out of perceived weaknesses in the unstructured clinical and actuarial approaches . next we review these approaches , including their primary features and their pros and cons . following that , we review research addressing their validity . clinical judgment . thus , although clinicians undoubtedly vary in their knowledge of which factors to consider when evaluating dangerousness and in their ability to properly assess and weigh those factors , we in fact do not accept the notion , suggested by others , that clinical judgments are merely subjective or impressionistic . therefore , over time , it is probable that use of this decision approach will produce decisions of lower reliability that are less strongly related to violence than a structured approach . moreover , if weighting of risk factors is involved , as it often is , the actuarial approach presumes that all risk factors would be weighted equivalently in different samples . further , attaching weights to risk factors presumes not only that they will apply equally across samples but that they apply equally to all persons within samples . similar reductions were observed for the sorag and static ninety nine . although the blair metaanalysis focused on correlational effect sizes , the findings suggest that the frequency estimates produced by some actuarial instruments may not generalize either . mills , jones , and kroner tested the generalizability of such frequency estimates among two hundred and nine offenders using the vrag and the level of service inventory revised . in nineteen ninety three , lidz , mulvey , and gardner published a study on clinical violence risk assessments that was deemed by monahan in nineteen ninety six to be , at that time , surely the most sophisticated study published on the clinical prediction of violence . the lidz study remains apposite , and we review it in some detail . in general , this research concluded that mental health professionals clinical judgments were significantly predictive of psychiatric patients violence . pairs of clinicians were asked to independently rate hundreds of psychiatric emergency department patients on a scale from one to five regarding the patients potential . violence toward others during the next six months . furthermore , although this study showed that clinicians , generally , did better than chance at predicting violence , this was true only for male patients . prediction for female patients was no better than chance . clinicians underestimated the risk posed by women . although it was estimated to be about half that of men , in fact the men and women had similar base rates of violence in the follow up period . and in a follow up analysis of these data , coontz , lidz , and mulvey showed that clinicians spent much less time asking questions about violence to female patients compared to male patients who had recently been violent . this is sometimes characterized as a process of prediction , although this is true only if the latter term is used loosely to mean understanding what might happen in the future rather than making precise , quantitative , probabilistic estimates of violence . the second step is to determine what events and occurrences might increase or decrease examinees potential for violence . we stress that clinicians should be able to articulate a clear rationale for considering case specific factors and should do so only if it is not possible to capture risk factors with the prespecified list available on the particular instrument . this will help to avoid the inclusion of risk factors that are unlikely to be associated with violence . in addition to identifying risk factors , spj guidelines discuss the nature and definition of the risk factors , summarize the evidence supporting their validity , and provide guidance for determining if they are or have been present over time in the case at hand . although the number of possible scenarios that could be constructed is virtually infinite , in any given case only a few distinct scenarios should seem reasonable , credible , or plausible in light of what is known about fact and theory . other scenarios will be perceived as implausible and subsequently dismissed , or pruned . the spj approach to developing scenarios of violence was derived from the more general management strategy known as scenario planning , which has been used for more than fifty years in such fields as business , health care , and the military . then , for each scenario , the evaluator develops a detailed description in terms of the nature , severity , imminence , frequency or duration , and likelihood of violence . finally , the evaluator trims the scenarios that seem implausible based on theory , research , experience , and case facts . in our experience , three to five general scenarios usually are sufficient to capture the range of plausible outcomes in a given case . step five : consider management plans . step six : communicate findings . in step six , evaluators should document and communicate their judgments regarding the overall risk in the case . evaluators are encouraged to make judgments concerning such things as case prioritization or overall risk for violence , risk for serious physical harm , any indication of other risks the examinee may pose , any immediate actions taken or required , and critical dates or triggers for case review . it is during this step that evaluators can assign ratings of low , moderate , or high risk the summary risk ratings discussed in detail earlier . these are the key , encapsulating judgments that professionals offer in order to inform risk management . as our research review demonstrated , they are as or more accurate than actuarial estimates . throughout the process , clinicians should make all reasonable efforts to obtain details of the patient history of violence and response to treatment for violence . for any reasonably comprehensive assessment , the painstaking assembling of facts and the checking of information from a variety of sources are essential . the examinee versions of events should be checked against collateral information , including police and victim versions of events . when patients appear to be at risk for violence , they should be asked if they are thinking of harming anyone and , if so , how they have dealt with such thoughts and feelings in the past . appelbaum and gutheil suggested that it is often useful to ask examinees whether they have ever caused the death or serious injury of another person , even if accidentally . quite often , however , patients are remarkably forthcoming about violence . consider the circumstances the examinee may be facing in the future . are these circumstances similar to those that have led to violence in the past ? or are these circumstances that have reduced the risk of violence in the past ? if the examinee will be returning to a less restrictive environment , does he or she demonstrate a meaningful understanding of how to avoid violence in the future ? has the examinee demonstrated a commitment to avoiding violence in the future ? in general , it is worth noting lion observation that an appearance of tranquility in a violent person can be deceptive . discharging the patient can be an error when the problem has not been really resolved . the clinician must consider whether anything has really changed . when in doubt , consult . indeed , when and where feasible , even when not in doubt , consult . simply put , it is both ethically and legally advisable to obtain a second , knowledgeable opinion about what to do when one is uncertain whether a patient poses a serious risk of causing serious harm to another person or persons . we make the next additional recommendations that are useful to consider in fulfilling the demands of comprehensive risk assessments that are ethically and legally defensible . treating clinicians , and ward staff in general , may become so invested in believing that particular patients under their care have made adequate progress , or may so want to avoid disrupting the relative equilibrium achieved by a formerly more disorganized patient , or may so want to support the aspirations of a wellliked patient , that they avoid seeing negative signs and confronting the patient with difficult but necessary questions . conversely , a patient who is uncooperative or challenging toward staff on the ward may be viewed as more dangerous than he or she really is . when inpatients pose a risk of serious violence , recommendations for release should not be made without subjecting the patient to stressful questions regarding the sources of his or her previous violence and what the patient needs to do to avoid violence in the future . as borum observed : many potentially violent patients can and will appear calm and nonthreatening when not challenged , frustrated , or irritated . indeed , sometimes the clinician inner sense that certain areas should be avoided lest the patient become overly disturbed is the best guide to determining what areas require further exploration . of course , there is no legitimate reason to provoke a patient needlessly . and clinicians should take reasonable steps to calm a disturbed patient once a stressful interview has ended . in any event , however , in order to pose suitably stressful questions to the patient , the assessor must be knowledgeable beforehand about the particular vulnerabilities of the patient . that is , in order to conduct an adequate stress interview , the clinician must first thoroughly inform him or herself about what has led to and triggered violence or regressions in the patient in the past . among the relevant recommendations are that the clinicians should : recognize their own legitimate doubts and legitimate disagreements between evaluators and among staff regarding an examinee risk level to avoid unjustifiably confident determinations of dangerousness in either direction . clinicians should avoid a judgmental perspective or aligning themselves too much with the patient wishes and desires . they should be open to information that contradicts their initial , or even stated , opinion . in this section , we review certain important legal developments concerning assessments of dangerousness by mental health professionals . assessments of dangerousness and the supreme court . despite qualms expressed by various professional organizations and legal commentators , and some of their own brethren , the supreme court of the united states has been receptive to assessments of dangerousness and risk by mental health professionals in a variety of circumstances . most notable perhaps , in barefoot estelle , by a six vote , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a sentence of death that was based in part on the prediction of a testifying psychiatrist that the probability that the defendant would commit additional crimes of violence in prison if not executed was one hundred percent and absolute . more recently , us supreme court justice stevens reasoned in his dissent in united states scheffer that here is no legal requirement that expert testimony must satisfy a particular degree of reliability to be admissible . expert testimony about a defendant future dangerousness to determine his eligibility for the death penalty , even if wrong most of the time , is routinely admitted . similarly , in kansas hendricks and kansas crane , the court voiced approval of risk assessment in the sexual predator context . in hendricks , the supreme court determined the constitutionality of a sexually violent predator statute , permitting the postincarceration civil commitment of sex offenders . the intent of the statute was to civilly detain people who presented a risk to public safety due to tendencies to perpetrate sexual violence . as with other types of civil commitment , a determination of future dangerousness was required by the statute . future dangerousness could be determined by past sexually violent behavior , such as the crime for which the individual was incarcerated , and a connection between that behavior and a mental abnormality reducing the individual control over the dangerous behavior . recent developments concerning the admissibility of testimony about violence risk . our own survey of state and federal cases considering the admissibility of expert testimony on risk assessment reveals that it is rarely excluded . testimony on risk assessment can be based on clinical interviewing techniques , reliance on results from actuarial instruments , or a combination of these techniques . moreover , little has changed in the federal courts since frye was supplanted by daubert . when testimony is based on the results of a clinical interview alone , courts typically admit the testimony , stating that clinical interviewing techniques are generally accepted . however , some courts have determined that reliance only on a clinical interview and failure to use actuarial instruments renders expert testimony unreliable . when the testimony is based in part on the results of actuarial instruments , typically it is also admitted . courts have not specifically stated that testimony based solely on the results of actuarial instruments would be excluded . however , this has been implied by court arguments that the testimony is admissible only because combined with clinical judgment . for example , one court stated : by this ruling , we are not concluding that actuarial risk assessment instruments are reliable per se or have our approval when used alone and not in conjunction with a full clinical evaluation . typically , courts argue that a frye or daubert evaluation of the evidence is inappropriate . many courts draw a distinction between clinical observations , which have a medical basis , and the use of actuarial instruments , which have a scientific basis . when this distinction is made , it is reasoned that a reliability analysis does not apply to the clinical observations because they are not scientific or novel , they are based on standard psychological analysis of behavioral observations , and they are based on experience . they reason that the instruments do not act as a source of infallible truth or scientific infallibility when combined with clinical judgment . other courts have argued that a frye or daubert analysis must be conducted when any part of the testimony is based on the actuarial instruments because they are scientific . these courts have largely determined that the use of actuarial instruments in risk assessment is generally accepted and reliable , and the testimony is admitted . however , some courts continue to reason that actuarial instruments are irrelevant and speculative in demonstrating lack of propensity for future risk of violence . other courts concluding that testimony based on actuarial instruments satisfies frye when used to predict recidivism require frye hearings when these tools are used for other purposes , such as demonstrating the existence of a mental illness . most of these decisions have arisen from frye jurisdictions , but reasoning about these cases in daubert jurisdictions does not differ substantially . the daubert factors are rarely applied to this type of testimony or are applied loosely . finally , many courts decline to assess reliability for the purpose of admission decisions , reasoning that questions of reliability go to the weight , not to the admissibility , of the evidence , or have determined that frye and daubert do not apply to the legal context of the case , such as sentencing . in addington texas , the us supreme court ruled that individuals could be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for an extended period of time only if there was clear and convincing evidence that they met a legitimate legal standard for confinement . therefore , to the extent that dangerousness as well as mental illness is required by law to justify an extended commitment , addington requires that such dangerousness be proven by clear and convincing evidence . indeed , in a nineteen ninety decision , the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled that a finding of substantial risk may be based on any activity that evinces a genuine possibility of future harm to persons or property . and the court also rejected the notion that , to be constitutional , a civil commitment must be based on a recent overt act or threat of violence . rather , the court stated , whether activity occurred recently is but one factor . to consider in weighing the evidence . the decision in the sahhar case is emblematic of a recent trend away from the strict standards for civil commitments that were established in some jurisdictions in the nineteen seventies to more flexible criteria . for example , in nineteen ninety one , the supreme court of massachusetts held that to the degree that the anticipated harm is serious . some lessening of a requirement of imminence seems justified ; and in seltzer hogue , a new york state appellate court upheld the continued confinement of a mentally ill person who in the past had invariably become violent following his release from hospitalization , even though he had not been imminently violent upon release . moreover , it should be pointed out , the us supreme court has ruled that insanity acquittees may be required to prove that they are no longer dangerous before being released from confinement . and in the case of in the matter of george , the new york court of appeals approvingly quoted from an earlier decision regarding insanity acquittees that compliance or lack of dangerousness in a facility does not necessarily mean that an individual does not suffer from a dangerous mental disorder . even more recently , regarding the retention of insanity acquittees , the new york court of appeals opined : in addition to recent acts of violence . the case law , research , and voluminous commentary that have followed from the tarasoff decision can not be reviewed here ; nor can the various laws and professional regulations defining tarasofflike duties that have been adopted in many states , or the differing responsibilities held by inpatient and outpatient clinicians . suffice it to say for the purposes of this chapter that clearly one component of the duty to protect is the duty to conduct a professionally adequate risk assessment when such an assessment is called for . the field of violence risk assessment has made considerable strides in recent years . for instance , there has been great conceptual progress on the process of risk assessment at the individual case level this topic would benefit greatly from a comparable amount of empirical attention . for instance , how do clinicians decide which risk factors are most relevant in a given case ? how do they integrate this information into formulations ? does this improve the quality of risk management ? yet many questions remain : which factors change ? what is the nature of change ? does change relate to changes in violence ? can we impact change deliberately ? for which risk factors ? sustained attention to dynamic risk will allow the field to continue to move toward a risk reduction or risk management focus . that is , studies of whether risk assessment instruments can be used to assign persons to treatment intensities , with specified relevant risk factors , are necessary . there is evidence from the correctional field that such a focus could indeed reduce violence . there has been a movement over the past decade or so to increase the focus on protective factors . as yet , the field of forensic mental health has not come to terms with the conceptual nature of protective factors and how they interact with risk factors . are they distinct from risk factors ? or are they the opposite pole of risk factors ? are they relevant in the absence of risk factors , or only when risk factors are present ? although hardly a new concern , we advocate continued efforts to test and ensure that risk assessment instruments can be used ethically with persons of all ethnic backgrounds , whether male or female , and regardless of sexual orientation . evidence drawn from metaanalyses suggests that it is unlikely that there are major problems in this regard . however , as described earlier concerning the process of risk assessment , there are other important topics to understand . one such topic is related to both assessing and improving predictive validity : to what extent might post release intervention or management moderate , and possibly improve , predictive accuracy ? we want our assessments to influence practice and reduce risk . hence , research should attempt to build expected treatment or intervention dosage into predictive models . one such example was recently provided by belfrage , who demonstrated that persons judged to be higher risk on the sara by police , who also received higher doses of risk management , were less likely to recidivate in the future relative to highrisk persons who received lower doses of management . although great strides have been made in the risk assessment field , it is clear that much important work remains .
