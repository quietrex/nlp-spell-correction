# nlp-spell-correction completed project
The spell-checking system consists of two main steps, which are error detection and error correction. Considering the advantages, using a dictionary alongside n-gram analysis may be a more robust method in detecting errors, especially when real word errors are involved. Moving on to error correction, the generation and ranking of the candidate words can be performed through an array of algorithms. Among methods such as rule-based method, neural networks, and n-gram analysis, edit-distance based methods may be a more parsimonious solution on this issue.  
	Moreover, with a simpler system, the results produced will also be more interpretable. In addition to that, the advantages offered by various libraries can be utilized by using a combination of the libraries. In this case, spacy may be used as the main NLP library. Meanwhile, by taking advantage of the greater customizability of both Keras and Tensorflow, they may be used to build spell-checking system tuned for the chosen domain.
