       "'THE potential for psychologists to assist the legal system has been rec-ognized since the early 20th century, but only within the past 50 years has psychology begun to realize this potential in meaningful ways. This  progress has included newly developed professional organizations, such as the American Psychology-Law Society and the International Association for Correc-tional and Forensic Psychology; graduate, internship, and fellowship programs in the specialty area (listed in www.ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php); organizations devoted to certifying qualified practitioners, such as the American Board of Forensic Psychology and the American Board of Police and Public Safety Psychology; such scientific journals as Law and Human Behavior, Behavioral Sciences and the Law, and Criminal Justice and Behavior; and books devoted to the interface of psychology and law. This specialty area has continued to grow rapidly since the previous edition of the Handbook of Forensic Psychology was published in 2006, with increasing numbers of psychologists becoming involved in forensic practice and research and a steady flow of new ideas and information becoming available.  This fourth edition of the Handbook of Forensic Psychology, like its predecessors, aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of forensic psychology, becoming familiar with the expand-ing research base in this specialty, and learning to apply forensic concepts artfully in everyday practice. To this end, the contributors to this volume, as in the prior three editions, are accomplished scholars and practitioners in their respective areas. Some are prominent academicians who conduct research and offer consultation. Others are actively engaged service providers who also make significant contribu-tions to the literature.

valuable contributions to this volume , both those who revised chapters that appeared in previous editions and those who joined us for the first time in this edition . we also want to acknowledge with appreciation the guidance and support of the john wiley and sons editorial staff , particularly patricia rossi , executive editor , and kara borbely , editorial program coordinator . finally , we recognize and honor the contributions of our colleague allen hess , who served as coeditor of the first three editions before his untimely death . readers familiar with previous editions of the handbook will recognize his fingerprints on this edition as well . in the course of writing this chapter over four editions of this handbook , we have learned a few lessons . in the first edition , we asserted that psychologists do not care about the history of their profession but are instead drawn to contemporary issues and theories . we learned that this was a simplistic generalization , so in subsequent editions we acknowledged that our initial statement had been rash . psychologists do care about history , as is apparent from numerous articles published in professional journals reviewing historical trends , the continuing publication of a journal devoted to the history of psychology , and special interest divisions of professional organizations , such as division twenty six , society for the history of psychology , of the american psychological association . we have also learned that there is some danger in proclaiming an event or a person a historic  first  or a  father ,  because these proclamations may be challenged , usually with kindness but not always with good humor . psychology , like other disciplines , needs historical insights . it needs to understand whence it came in order to assess where it is going . a perusal of journals and books published at the turn of the twentieth century , for example , may spark interest in a concept long forgotten or a predecessor whose theories and research deserve to be revisited . yet delving into early works reminds us of false starts and the occasional damage they did , such as the work of henry h. goddard on feeblemindedness during the early one thousand, nine hundreds and the selfpromotion of hugo munsterberg¨ . however , we have also learned that hindsight is imperfect ; people are sometimes overlooked , and the historical discoveries may be incomplete . we thus approach this chapter once again with humility . to paraphrase the phrase that  journalism is the first rough draft of history ,  we say here that this chapter is our fourth rough draft of the history of forensic psychology , with emphasis on its american origins . in these early years of the twenty first century , forensic psychology remains a young branch of applied psychology , having been recognized by the apa as a specialty in two thousand and one and recertified in two thousand and eight. even before that , in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety one , specialty guidelines for forensic psychologists were adopted by the american psychology–law society , which is division forty one of the apa . these guidelines were recently revised , renamed specialty guidelines for forensic psychology , and accepted by the apa council of representatives . interestingly , although forensic psychology was initially viewed as primarily clinical in nature such as by providing assessments to the courts its scope has broadened to encompass the practice of psychology as it provides expertise to the law in a very wide range of contexts . this broad view of forensic psychology was not always supported . according to ronald roesch , for example ,  most psychologists define the area more narrowly to refer to clinical psychologists who are engaged in clinical practice within the legal system.  a few years later , brigham and grisso modified this somewhat , noting  many psychologists define forensic psychology more narrowly to refer to clinical psychologists who are engaged in clinical practice within the legal system . the distinction here is between psychologists who bring scientific information to the courts for their consideration in cases and psychologists who evaluate individuals and testify about them in reference to a legal question  . in recognizing forensic psychology as a specialty in two thousand and one , the apa itself adopted the narrow approach , to include  the primarily clinical aspects of forensic assessment , treatment , and consultation  . however , as noted , the specialty guidelines take a broader view.in this chapter , forensic psychology is being viewed broadly . it is both the research endeavor that examines aspects of human behavior directly related to the legal process and the professional practice of psychology within or in consultation with a legal system that encompasses both criminal and civil law and the numerous areas where they intersect . therefore , the term forensic psychology refers broadly to the production of psychological knowledge and its application to the civil and criminal justice systems . it includes activities as varied as these : courtroom testimony , child custody evaluations , law enforcement candidate screening , treatment of offenders in correctional facilities , assessment of plaintiffs with disability claims , research and theory building in the area of criminal behavior , and the design and implementation of intervention and prevention programs for youthful offenders . a review of the table of contents of this handbook indicates a similarly broad focus.in the pages to follow , after an introductory section covering seminal contributions , we review developments in four major areas of forensic psychology : legal psychology , correctional psychology , police psychology , and criminal psychology . readers will undoubtedly recognize that there is considerable overlap in these categories and in the subheadings . correctional psychology , for example , presupposes some understanding of criminal psychology . assessment , which we cover under legal psychology , is an essential tool of the trade for psychologists , and it underlies all practice . nonetheless , for purposes of identifying historical trends and landmarks , discussion of these four distinctive areas is warranted . we focus on forensic psychology rather than forensic psychiatry , which has its own welldocumented and rich history , probably centered on the early work of isaac ray , who is considered by some the father of forensic psychiatry . we also do not delve into the origins of the sociology of law , referred to as sociological jurisprudence , or the legal realism movement within the law itself . this movement , born during the first third of the twentieth century , advocated a partnership between the law and the social sciences . in addition , we emphasize the work of forensic psychologists in the united states and , to a lesser extent , oneanada,1 although we give due recognition to the work of european psychologists , who dominated the field prior to world war i. we review the achievements of psychologists from the end of the nineteeth century and extend our discussion into the nineteen seventies , when forensic psychology came of age . the reader interested in more detail about the issues and individuals discussed might check landmark summaries of psychology and law published by whipple , hutchins and slesinger , louisell , tapp , loh , and monahan and loftus . more recently , brigham and grisso and mulberger¨ have published historical pieces on this topic , the latter with a strong emphasis on german influences . on the whole , however , developments from the nineteen eighties forward are addressed in the works of other contributors to this handbook . legal psychology . legal psychology refers to psychological theory , research , and practice directly pertinent to the law and legal issues . it focuses on psycholegal research and contacts with judges , lawyers , and other lawrelated professionals in a wide range of contexts . the origins of legal psychology can be traced to the work of experimental psychologists in europe in the nineteeth century , particularly in relation to the psychology of testimony and most particularly to the testimony of children , whose memory of events was considered unreliable . we discuss this work shortly.do chestnut or oak trees lose their leaves earlier in autumn ? do horses in the field stand with head or tail to the wind ? in which direction do the seeds of an apple point ? what was the weather one week ago today ? when j. mckeen cattell posed these questions to fifty six college students at columbia university in march one thousand, eight hundred and ninety three , he was probably conducting one of the first american studies , albeit an informal one , on the psychology of testimony . the questions he asked his students were similar to those that  might naturally be asked in a court of justice  . his subjects were allowed thirty seconds to consider their answers , then told to write their responses and indicate their degree of confidence in each answer . when cattell conducted his informal and preliminary study , it was reasonably well established that eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable and incomplete . as we will see shortly , both french and german psychologists were familiar with the powerful influence of suggestion over sensation and perception , having conducted substantial research in these areas . the specific conditions under which testimony was inaccurate were not known , however . cattell noted :  an unscrupulous attorney can discredit the statements of a truthful witness by cunningly selected questions . the jury , or at least the judge , should know how far errors in recollection are normal and how they vary under different conditions  . but cattell himself was surprised at both the degree of inaccuracy he uncovered and the wide range of individual differences in the levels of confidence expressed by the students . answers to the weather question , for example , were  equally distributed over all kinds of weather which are possible at the beginning of march  . some students were nearly always sure they were correct , even when they were not , while others were consistently uncertain and hesitant in their answers , even when they were correct . cattell study probably was the genesis of modern forensic psychology in the united states , because it sparked the interest of other researchers in the psychology of testimony , which remains to this day a dominant research interest among legal psychologists . joseph jastrow immediately replicated cattell  experiment  at the university of wisconsin and obtained similar results . aside from this brief flirtation , however , american psychologists did not immediately embrace the study of legal issues . psychologists in europe seemed more intrigued they had long been interested in the psychological concepts involved . first , alfred binet replicated cattell project in france . in addition , he summarized relevant experiments on the psychology of testimony that were being conducted in europe , and he eventually called for a  science psychojudiciaire  .most significant for the historical development of forensic psychology was the apparent fascination cattell experiment and binet work held for william stern , who had received his doctorate in psychology at the university of berlin under the tutelage of hermann ebbinghaus . in one thousand, nine hundred and one , stern collaborated with the criminologist f. v. liszt in an attempt to lend realism to the cattell design . stern and liszt conducted a  reality experiment  in a law class , staging a bogus quarrel between two students over a scientific controversy . as stern later recounted it , the argument accelerated until one student drew a revolver . at this point , the professor intervened and asked for written and oral reports from the class about aspects of the dispute . although the witnesses were law students who , stern asserted , should have known the pitfalls of testifying , none could give a faultless report . the number of errors per individual ranged from four to twelve. moreover , the researchers found that inaccuracies increased with respect to the second half of the scenario , when excitement and tension were at their peak . they concluded tentatively that  affective reactions inhibit exact observation and reliable remembrance  . by his own account , stern was more interested in basic research than its application .  indeed , when i began in one thousand, nine hundred and one to examine the correctness of recollection among my students , i was determined by theoretical interests in the realm of memory rather than by any practical considerations . yet once confronted with the results , i realized the importance of this research beyond the borders of mere academic psychology  . throughout that first decade of the twentieth century , stern was an active researcher in the psychology of testimony . he also helped establish and edited the first journal on the psychology of testimony , betrage zur psychologie der aussage , which was published in leipzig . the journal was superseded in one thousand, nine hundred and seven by the much broader zeitschrift fur¨ angewande psychologie , edited by stern and his colleague otto lipmann . in a cautionary note about his research , stern stressed that most witnesses did not intentionally falsify their reports . rather , the subtle and common problem created was one of unintentional falsification :  subjective sincerity does not guarantee objective truthfulness ,  he wrote . in his research , stern concluded among other things that : leading and suggestive questions contaminate the accuracy of eyewitness accounts of critical events ; there are important differences between adult and child witnesses ; lineups are of limited value when the members are not matched for age and physical appearance ; and interceding events between an initial event and its recall can have drastic effects on memory . therefore , modern forensic psychology began as legal psychology with empirical research on the psychology of testimony . courtroom testimony . pinpointing the origins of courtroom testimony by psychologists in europe is not easy . sources differ , often depending on the nature of the forum or its context . hale suggests that the earliest testimony by a psychologist in a criminal court occurred in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety six , when albert von schrencknotzing testified at the trial of a munich man accused of murdering three women . the murders had received extensive and sensational press coverage in the months prior to the trial , and schrencknotzing opined that this pretrial publicity , through a process of suggestion , probably led numerous witnesses to retroactive memoryfalsification . witnesses could not distinguish between what they had seen and what the press reported had happened . schrencknotzing supported this opinion with social framework testimony in the form of accounts of laboratory research on memory and suggestibility . although the accused was convicted on the basis of solid evidence , schrencknotzing direct application of the psychology of suggestion to court processes helped stimulate the interest of both german jurists and psychologists . however , karl marbe , a psychology professor at the university of wurzburg , credited himself with the first court appearance , fifteen years later .  the first german psychological legal expert opinion was my testimony in a case of sexual assault in wurzburg in one thousand, nine hundred and eleven , in which i had to discuss the question of the testimony of children  . in that case , several german adolescent girls had accused their teacher of sexually molesting them . marbe persuaded the jury that the girls ’ statements were unreliable , and the teacher was exonerated . also in one thousand, nine hundred and eleven , several psychologists testified in a belgian murder trial in which a man was accused of raping and killing a nineyearold girl . two of the child playmates had apparently seen the murderer but gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts . among the psychologists retained by the defense was julian varendonck , who designed a series of experiments based on questions suggested by information obtained at the preliminary hearing . varendonck subjects were children of approximately the same age as the two witnesses . he found that they were inaccurate in their recall of important events . over the objection of the prosecution , he was allowed to present the results of these experiments as well as the general research on the psychology of testimony that was available at that time . whipple wrote that varendonck testimony  elicited violent outbursts from the court authorities , but it reached the jury and induced a verdict of ‘ not guilty ’  , whipple added that the psychology of testimony had  found its way formally into the court room and saved a man life.  the jury found the defendant not guilty . varendonck , it should be noted , was vehemently opposed to any use of child witnesses in the courtroom . in contrast , both binet and stern believed that errors in recollection , whether by children or adults , were more a reflection of leading , suggestive courtroom questioning than of any  natural  tendency to distort reality.in one thousand, nine hundred and twelve , marbe became one of the earliest european psychologists to testify at a civil trial , offering expert opinion on the psychological issue of reaction times as applied to a train wreck near mullheim¨ . marbe was asked to testify as to the probable effect of alcohol both on the mental status of the engineer and the reaction time of the fireman and guard applying the brakes . based on reaction time experiments , marbe testified that the train could not have been stopped in time to avert a disaster . as he did in the criminal case , marbe appears to take credit for paving the way for other psychologists :  since that time , through my agency and that of others , a mass of psychological expert testimony has been submitted , bearing continually upon new circumstances  . although mulberger¨ wrote that other psychologists were testifying in civil courts even before marbe time , it is difficult to find written documentation of who they might have been . marbe , along with stern , has been credited with developing forensic psychology in germany . in essence , it is not difficult to find illustrations of psychologists who had impact on the nascent field of legal psychology , but ranking their contributions chronologically must be done with caution . european psychologists at the turn of the twentieth century and until world war i also were delving into the area of guilt deception , the precursor of the lie detection of today . in one thousand, nine hundred and four , psychologists in germany , austria , and switzerland were busy developing a lie detection test for use in criminal investigations . the test was a word association/reaction time task in which key words were embedded in a list of innocuous words . presumably , the slower the reaction time in recognizing the key words , the more likely the respondent was trying to deceive . barland , who has reviewed this history in impressive detail , notes that this approach did not catch on because it was inefficient , time consuming , and often yielded inconclusive results.at the turn of the twentieth century , american psychologists remained comparatively uninterested in applying research on topics related to law . one reason was that they were just beginning to explore the broad psychological landscape and had little inclination to specialize in lawrelated matters . this reticence was probably also due to the influence of wilhelm wundt , who had trained many of the american pioneers in his leipzig laboratory . wundt , a philosopher and an experimentalist , was wary of applying psychology until sufficient research had been conducted . he believed that the premature use of partial information could be disastrous . his students often took this caveat quite seriously , although some , like cattell , eventually began to link the laboratory to the world outside . one of wundt not-so-cautious students was the german psychologist hugo munsterberg , ¨ who arrived in the united states in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety two at the invitation of william james to direct the psychology laboratory at harvard university . munsterberg¨ spent twenty four years trying to persuade the public that psychology had something to offer virtually every area of human endeavor . now acknowledged by many as the father of applied psychology , he believed psychological knowledge could be applied to education , industry , advertising , music , art , and , of course , law . his claims were often exaggerated , however , and his proposals were rarely empirically based . he usually published in popular magazines rather than in scholarly journals . he also incessantly promoted himself and his native germany , a practice that alienated him increasingly from his colleagues and the public as world war i approached . in fact , his ardent progerman stance may have had as much to do with the public antipathy toward him as his abrasive personality . not surprisingly , the legal community vehemently resisted his intrusion into its territory , and there was much ado about this . charles c. moore , a wellknown attorney , referred to munsterberg ’ s¨ work as  yellow psychology  and concluded that it provided nothing new or helpful to the court . most noteworthy , the great legal commentator john henry wigmore found it necessary to assail munsterberg¨ in a satirical and devastating law review article . wigmore attack was prompted by the publication of munsterberg ’ s¨ controversial bestseller on the witness stand , in which he proclaimed that the time was ripe to apply psychology to the practical needs of the legal system . the book which was essentially a compilation of already published columns dealt with a wide spectrum of topics , ranging from witness accuracy and jury persuasion to hypnosis and lie detection . in one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen , munsterberg¨ published a study on group decision making , using harvard and radcliffe students as subjects , which he titled  the mind of the juryman.  in a conclusion not atypical of the times , he stated that  the psychologist has every reason to be satisfied with the jury system as long as the women are kept out of it  . he based his conclusion on a finding that the female students in his study were less accurate in their final decisions than the male students . interestingly , as will be noted shortly , one of his own students later arrived at a very different conclusion . munsterberg , ¨ always willing to give speeches , gave his inaugural lecture at radcliffe college in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety four and his last at the same location in one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen , when he suddenly died of a heart attack midsentence while lecturing his general psychology class . landy wrote that  at the time of his death . . . munsterberg¨ was an object of public scorn and was well on the way to professional ostracism . by one thousand, nine hundred and nineteen , less than three years after his death , there was hardly any reference to any of his more than ten books and dozens of articles in basic and applied psychology  . benjamin noted that munsterberg¨  was one of the most despised individuals in america  . interestingly , in a recent article , sporer correctly pointed out that much valuable information about early contributions of other individuals in legal psychology has been lost because of excessive focus on munsterberg¨ . in similar fashion , bornstein and penrod sought to resurrect the longignored work of george frederick arnold , a civil servant in the british empire who published psychology applied to legal evidence and other constructions of law in one thousand, nine hundred and six , two years before munsterberg ’ s¨ on the witness stand . bornstein and penrod admirably compared the value of these respective texts , noting that arnold , even though he was not an academician , displayed an impressive familiarity with the psychological literature of the day . they noted also that his style was dry and  reads like the serious academic tome that it is  , whereas munsterberg ’ s¨ style was directed at a general , less serious audience . bornstein and penrod are to be commended for bringing attention to this obscure work , but the fact remains that arnold overall contributions were not as far reaching as those of munsterberg¨ . munsterberg¨ has been accused of being more an opportunist than a trailblazer , however . it is tempting to blame his brashness , his apparently despicable demeanor , and his progerman views for the tenuous and occasionally hostile initial relationship between psychology and law . nonetheless , he undeniably pushed his reluctant american colleagues into the practical legal arena and made a seminal contribution to applied psychology in general and forensic psychology in particular . world war i placed in abeyance most of the exploration in applying psychology to law , although the war and early postwar years saw a few landmarks in american forensic psychology , including the gradual acceptance of psychologists as expert witnesses . the first psychologists , along with other social scientists , were also appointed to law school faculties during these years . psychologist donald slesinger , a proteg´e´ of robert m. hutchins , made his mark during the years immediately following world war i. although he had no formal legal training , slesinger was appointed by acting dean hutchins as a oneyear sterling fellow to the yale law school in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty seven. the following year , he became a research assistant . in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty nine , he was appointed associate professor , teaching a course in the psychology of evidence , which appears to qualify him as the first psychologist granted faculty status in an american law school . in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty , slesinger followed hutchins to the university of chicago , where he served as professor of law and , briefly , as dean of the law school . several years earlier , psychologist william marston had been the first to receive a faculty appointment as professor of legal psychology when he joined the faculty at american university in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty two. marston was by far the most influential psychologist associated with the legal system during this era . he was a student of munsterberg¨ but did not have his mentor penchant for alienating the legal community and much of the american public . he received a law degree in one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen and a phd in psychology in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty one , both from harvard . marston interests were multifaceted . although admitted to the massachusetts bar , marston soon gave up his law practice to concentrate on psychology . as a laboratory assistant in psychology at radcliffe college , marston had discovered a significant positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and lying , which became the basis of the modern polygraph . in fact , marston was the psychologist who testified in the landmark case frye v. u.s. , the case that set the original standard for the acceptance of expert testimony in federal courts . although his continuing work in lie detection represents one of his major contributions to the forensic area , it was by no means the only one . he frequently consulted with attorneys , police , and other criminal justice personnel , and his evidence was determinative in the acquittals of several defendants accused of murder . it is likely , therefore , that marston along with lewis terman and psychologists associated with the new york city psychopathic clinic qualifies as one of the first psychological consultants to the criminal justice system in the united states . marston also conducted the first serious research on the jury system . using subjects in simulated jury conditions , he found in a series of studies that written evidence was superior to oral evidence ; free narration , though less complete , was more accurate than crossexamination or direct questioning ; a witness caution in answering was a good indicator of accuracy ; and female jurors considered evidence more carefully than male jurors . because of his legal background and his cautious style , marston ideas and research were more acceptable to the legal community than munsterberg ’ s¨ had been , although there is little evidence that the legal system put his findings to extensive use . this is not surprising because some of his recommendations were inapposite to the adversarial process in the united states , and others would have required fundamental changes in court procedures . interestingly , the german psychologist stern , discussed earlier , had cautioned his colleagues that experimental research in psychology might be of more relevance to the inquisitorial process used in european courts , where a neutral jurist asked questions of witnesses , than to the adversarial process in the united states . also during this time period , various reviewers took on the task of documenting the progress of legal psychology . hutchins and slesinger , for example , coauthored numerous summary articles on its status . slesinger wrote another article with marion pilpel in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty nine , surveying forty eight articles written by psychologists on issues relating to the law that had appeared in professional journals up to that time . eleven were concerned with the psychology of testimony , ten with deception , seven with intelligence and crime , and six with criminal behavior . the remainder focused on general topics such as the scientific method or legal research . fifteen of the forty eight articles had been written by german psychologists . like applied psychology in general , legal psychology was somewhat dormant between the two world wars and did not regain its energy until the late nineteen forties and nineteen fifties . in addition to marston work , the period did see scattered research on how juries formed opinions and verdicts , a master thesis on the relationship between narrative and interrogative methods of questioning , another study on questioning and testimony , and a survey of legal and psychological opinions about the validity of some of wigmore rules of evidence . according to loh , there was some interest in psychology and law during the late nineteen twenties and the nineteen thirties . however , this interest was almost exclusively on the part of lawyers , who produced such books as legal psychology , psychology for the lawyer , and law and the social sciences . wigmore , the foremost authority on rules of evidence , paved the way for the use of test data in the courtroom . he observed that the psychometrist introducing test evidence would stand  on the same footing as the expert witness to insanity  , as long as such tests are recognized as valid and feasible by the general scientific community . in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty one , psychologist harold burtt wrote legal psychology , possibly the first textbook in the area . disputing this claim , mulberger¨ commented that the german psychologist otto lipmann had published a psychological textbook for jurists long before this . the truth may depend on the meaning of the word textbook . lipmann clearly deserves credit for his work , which was a compilation of the lectures he gave to students studying law . lipmann book was specifically intended to educate current and future judges and lawyers , whereas burtt book was intended for both lawyers and students of applied psychology . nevertheless , although burtt book made a valuable contribution to the academic psychological literature , it had little discernible influence on the legal profession or on applied psychology in general . in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty five , edward s. robinson published law and the lawyers , which predicted that jurisprudence would become one of the family of social sciences and argued that all of its fundamental concepts must be brought into line with psychological knowledge . the book was lambasted by lawyers and essentially ignored by psychologists . in hindsight , later scholars found robinson ideas much more palatable . it is generally believed that american psychologists have served as expert witnesses since the early nineteen twenties , but , like their european counterparts , they consulted with lawyers and the courts , perhaps particularly the civil courts , before that time . included in this latter category are the juvenile courts , which were a hybrid of the civil and the criminal , dealing with matters of both child protection and delinquency . psychological consultation with juvenile courts was common from their inception in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety nine . consultation with and testimony in criminal courts was much less common , as we discuss shortly . according to rogers , the results of experimental research on visual perception were routinely accepted in trademark infringement cases . in cocacola company v. cherocola company , for example , an experimental psychologist was asked whether the trademarks used by the two companies were so similar as to be likely to cause confusion in the public mind and ultimately deceive the consumer . this was apparently considered a  safe  undertaking , as the psychologists were not infringing on the territory of the  medical experts  physicians and psychiatrists who routinely testified on matters of criminal responsibility . as louisell noted , however , because trial court records are generally unavailable and only appellate decisions are published , the testimony of psychologists , particularly in civil cases , may have been less rare than the paucity of documentation would indicate . we do know that psychological testimony was almost inevitably rejected in criminal cases involving the defendant mental state .  as a general rule , only medical men that is , persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine can testify as experts on the question of insanity ; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion  . the first published case in which an american psychologist qualified as an expert appears to be state v. driver in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty one. the occasion was only a partial victory for forensic psychology , however . a west virginia trial court accepted the chief psychologist of the state bureau of juvenile research as an expert on the matter of juvenile delinquency . however , it rejected his testimony , based on psychological test data , that a twelveyearold alleged victim of an attempted rape was a  moron  and could not be presumptively believed . in agreeing with the trial court , the west virginia supreme court noted ,  it is yet to be demonstrated that psychological and medical tests are practical , and will detect the lie on the witness stand  . although some commentators interpreted driver as a major loss for psychologists wishing to achieve status as expert witnesses , louisell noted that the decision was not a rejection of psychologists per se , only of the particular evidence offered by one psychologist . nevertheless , it was not until much later , in the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties , that psychologists testified in courts of law on a regular basis , at least in some jurisdictions . they offered opinions and presented data relevant to subjects as diverse as the influence of pretrial publicity on potential witnesses and juries , the effects of pornography on adolescents , the effect of certain educational practices on children , and the likely influence of advertisements on consumers . this is not to say that there was widespread acceptance of the idea that psychologists deserved a niche in the courtroom . resistance to the idea , or at best a cautious approach , consistently characterized much of the legal literature . in the early nineteen forties and the post–world war ii era , appellate courts also began to hand down rulings that allowed psychologists to offer expert testimony in trial courts on the issue of mental responsibility for criminal and tortious conduct . loh attributed this eventual acceptance to an increase in professionalization ,  the rapid growth of mental health professions during this period , and the formulation of legal doctrines of insanity consistent with modern psychiatry  . one important decision , perhaps the first influential decision , was people v. hawthorne , a michigan case . hawthorne had been tried for the murder of his wife lover and had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . the trial court refused to qualify as an expert witness a professor of psychology from michigan state normal college who had a doctoral degree and an impressive list of credentials . in finding that the trial court had erred in not accepting the psychologist as an expert , the michigan supreme court ruled that the standard for determining expert status was not a medical degree but the extent of the witness knowledge . it advised trial courts to evaluate carefully the merits of a potential witness claim to expertise , noting that a psychologist ability to detect insanity could not be presumed inferior to that of a  medical man.  the dissenters , however , believed that insanity is a disease and therefore only a person with medical training should qualify as an expert . later , in hidden v. mutual life insurance co. , the fourth circuit court of appeals allowed psychological expertise to be applied to a civil case relating to mental status . the plaintiff argued that a disabling nervous condition prevented him from engaging in any gainful occupation and entitled him to disability benefits . a clinical psychologist with a doctoral degree administered a battery of projective tests and testified on his behalf . not only did he report on the test results , but he also gave the opinion that the plaintiff deserved the benefits . when the lawyer for the insurance company objected , the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the entire opinion testimony on the grounds that the psychologist did not qualify as an expert . the circuit court of appeals ruled that the psychologist should have been qualified as an expert to express his opinion about the plaintiff mental condition . while some psychologists were struggling to be accepted as experts on questions of mental status , competence , and criminal responsibility , others during this era were joining the crucial legal battle against school segregation by testifying and consulting with attorneys in the state cases that would ultimately culminate in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty four landmark ruling brown v. board of education . david krech and helen trager , social psychologists who had published articles on racial attitude tests , and horace b. english , an expert on child psychology , were among many who testified for the plaintiffs at some of the school segregation trials . psychologist henry garrett , a former president of the apa , testified on behalf of the state . perhaps the most widely publicized and since then highly critiqued contribution on behalf of the plaintiffs was that of kenneth clark and mamie clark , who conducted the nowfamous  doll research  to gauge the effects of segregation . kenneth clark then gave social framework testimony reporting the results of this research . when the national association for the advancement of colored people appealed brown and three other segregation cases to the u.s. supreme court , kenneth clark , isidor chein , and stuart w. cook wrote the social science statement that included signatures of thirty two eminent social scientists . this was not , however , the first social science brief to be submitted to an appellate court . according to brigham and grisso , that distinction belongs to the brief submitted to the oregon supreme court in muller v. oregon . in that case , louis brandeis who later became a prominent justice of the u.s. supreme court argued in support of the state that work hours of women should be limited because social science data demonstrated their inherent weakness . history has not been kind to the scientists in either case . brandeis patriarchal argument in the muller case would be deplored and roundly denounced today , both for its tenor and for its lack of empirical support and rigor . social scientists in the brown case were criticized for their naive methodology , lack of objectivity , and faulty conclusions based on insufficient scientific evidence . in his historiographical inquiry , however , jackson noted that the doll experiments were but one prong of many studies that psychologists and other social scientists referenced in their trial testimony and in the brief submitted to the supreme court . he also argued convincingly that critiques of these social scientists reflected a misreading of their testimony , their research , and their evaluation of relevant evidence . during the same era , psychologists were continuing to make enough inroads testifying on the issue of criminal responsibility that psychiatrists felt the need to protect their turf . in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty four , the council of the american psychiatric association , the executive council of the american psychoanalytical association , and the american medical association joined in a resolution stating that only physicians were legitimate experts in the field of mental illness for purposes of courtroom testimony . other individuals could participate only if their testimony was coordinated by medical authority . the resolution greatly influenced trial courts , which became reluctant to accept independent psychological testimony . finally , in jenkins v. united states , the court of appeals for the district of columbia gave its own direct , although conditional , support to the use of psychologists as experts on the issue of mental illness . although the court was sharply divided , its decision remains the predominant authority for the use of psychologists in the area of criminal responsibility . following that opinion , federal courts and increasingly more state courts certified psychologists as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases . during the years in which munsterberg¨ was proselytizing about psychology usefulness in the courtroom , particularly involving expert testimony , another american psychologist was more quietly making inroads into a different forensic area , one specifically related to juvenile courts . as we noted earlier , consultation with these courts was common , but it was chiefly in the area of assessment . in one thousand, nine hundred and nine , clinical psychologist grace m. fernald worked with psychiatrist william healy to establish the first clinic designed for youthful offenders , the juvenile psychopathic institute . it was initially developed to serve the newly established juvenile court of chicago by offering diagnoses of  problem  children . fernald , who received her doctorate from the university of chicago in one thousand, nine hundred and seven , was probably the first clinical psychologist to work under the supervision of a psychiatrist as well as one of the earliest psychologists to specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents who appeared before the juvenile courts . the institute , which extended its services rapidly to include treatment and research as well as diagnosis , became a public agency in one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen , the institute for juvenile research . arguably , it also provided the earliest formal internships in forensic psychology in the country . fernald and healy used the relatively new stanfordbinet intelligence scale to assess delinquents , but they soon realized the importance of obtaining  performance  measures as well . this prompted them to develop the healyfernald series of twenty three performance tests , which they began using in one thousand, nine hundred and eleven. the two eventually went their separate ways . fernald became a specialist in intellectual disability and intelligence and testing and taught psychology at the university of california–los angeles for twenty seven years , until her retirement in one thousand, nine hundred and forty eight. healy , along with psychologist augusta bronner , went on to establish the judge baker clinic in boston in one thousand, nine hundred and seventeen. during the first third of the twentieth century , most psychologists providing regular services to the courts were psychometrists associated with clinics . the term forensic psychology had not been minted , and legal psychologists were in the halls of academe or consulting sporadically with judges and lawyers . thus , it seems that much of the forensic work of psychologists during this period consisted of cognitive and personality assessments of individuals , both juveniles and adults , who were to come before the courts . the drudgery of day-to-day testing made applied psychology unappealing as a profession . often , however , it was where female psychologists were most accepted . in the nineteen thirties , for example , fewer than onethird of all american psychologists were women , but women made up over sixty percent of all applied psychologists . in one of the first published accounts of the work of these early psychometrists , e. i. keller described some of the challenges they faced . he noted that in december one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen , a psychopathic laboratory was established at the new york city police department for the express purpose of examining persons detained before trial . the staff included psychiatrists , neurologists , social workers , and psychologists , whose task was to conduct hasty pretrial evaluations . according to keller , who was a consulting psychologist at the clinic , detainees arrived for testing at nine a.m.  the disadvantage is the lack of time , for all prisoners must be examined in time to get them to court by noon or earlier , and many courts are situated in distant parts of the city  . staff members had little time in which to conduct the evaluation and prepare a report that would help the court in its decision making . the work of henry h. goddard during this time must in hindsight be regarded with embarrassment . a student of noted psychologist g. stanley hall , goddard paved the way for the massive intelligence testing of immigrants and residents of mental institutions , prisons , and juvenile training schools . his followers consulted with the juvenile courts and dutifully administered these tests to the children of the poor who arrived at their door . goddard warning that  feebleminded  individuals should not be allowed to roam about freely in society because of their innate proclivity toward antisocial behavior contributed significantly to the incarceration of individuals during their reproductive periods and the sterilization of residents in both juvenile and adult facilities . an article in volume one of the american psychologist carried the following job description for a court psychologist . interviews offenders referred by the court to determine the causes of the crime , the attitudes and conflicts , and the educational , vocational , and social background of the client . also may interview parents and guardians . administers and interprets individual intelligence , performance , and personality tests including projective techniques . writes complete case histories including interview information and test interpretations . presents case histories and recommended treatment to colleagues including medical and other officers of the court . may testify in court . qualifications include ma in psychology with a phd preferred , relevant course work , previous experience , and emotional maturity . interestingly , shartle noted that , although few psychologists were employed in such positions , there was indication that employment in the field would increase . however ,  higher positions  in the court were not usually open to psychologists . lindner pinpointed one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen as the date when psychological services were first offered in a u.s. correctional facility , specifically a women reformatory in the state of new york . watkins identified the psychologist as eleanor rowland , who was asked to devise a test battery to identify offenders who would benefit from educational programs and be safely returned to society . however , the main function of psychologists employed in some capacity in the state and federal correctional systems during these years was apparently the detection of  feeblemindedness  among offenders , a condition thought to lead to a life of crime . again , the work of goddard and his followers is relevant . concurrently , however , some psychologists like rowland became involved in a different endeavor : the classification of inmates into various groups for determining where they were to be placed and what services might be provided . the first prison classification system developed by psychologists was apparently instituted in new jersey in one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen . new jersey also became the first state to hire a fulltime correctional psychologist . the first state in the united states to provide comprehensive psychological examinations of all admissions to its prison system and applications for parole was wisconsin , in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty four . in the late nineteen thirties , darley and berdie surveyed thirteen federal and one hundred and twenty three state prisons and learned that they employed a total of sixty four psychologists who called themselves  prison psychologists.  although all considered themselves clinical psychologists , only about half had doctorates in psychology . later , raymond corsini expressed concern that there was as yet  no history of prison psychology.  he estimated that during the nineteen forties , there were approximately two hundred individuals confined in u.s. correctional facilities who were served by a mere eighty psychologists . their work consisted of testing ; providing educational , vocational , and personal guidance ; and maintaining working relationships with all members of the prison staff . in one of the most comprehensive surveys undertaken during the early nineteen forties , questionnaires were sent to four psychologists in an effort to discover the nature of the profession . of the three questionnaires returned in one thousand, nine hundred and forty , seventy six men and twenty women indicated they were employed as fulltime psychologists in prisons or correctional institutions . of the three questionnaires returned by the same group in one thousand, nine hundred and forty four , fifty three men and twenty seven women said they were employed in prisons or correctional institutions . although these data support corsini estimation that between eighty and one hundred psychologists were employed in the nation correctional facilities during the early to one thousand, nine hundred and forty940s , it is interesting to note that , by the one thousand, nine hundred and forty940s , approximately onethird of prison psychologists were women . in volume one of the american psychologist , shartle described the work of a prison psychologist . administers intelligence , aptitude , and other tests to either all inmates or certain groups depending on institutional policy . writes an interpretation of test results for the prisoner records . interviews each prisoner to determine background , attitudes , and personality traits for use in guidance , education , possibilities for parole , and placement . results of interview are written and may be submitted in form of case study with test results or other reports . makes recommendations for parole and supplies technical information at staff meetings . gives information in consultation with administrative officers or with specialists in the field of medicine , psychiatry , sociology , education , occupational training , or parole . assists in planning or revising programs for medically sponsored cases including psychiatric and severe physical disability cases . participates in research . investigates problems of penal psychology or test construction and prepares reports of finding . again it was noted that opportunities in the field were limited and the number of openings not numerous . however , several states were planning postwar expansion in buildings and services . psychologists entered the canadian correctional system much later , perhaps as late as the early nineteen fifties . watkins notes that canadian correctional psychology made its first appearance in the literature in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty two in a series of newsletters published by the ontario psychological association . the newsletters focused on psychology in the ontario provincial corrections programs and the federal correctional service . the first correctional psychologist in the federal system in canada was employed in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty five at st. vincent de paul penitentiary in quebec . correctional psychologists in canada were at first employed primarily to classify inmates for security placement and were usually not a component of the mental health treatment afforded to inmates . in the united states , their role appears to have been broader . since these early days , however , canada in many ways has outpaced american corrections particularly state prison systems both in developing risk assessment instruments and providing rehabilitation services to inmates . classification , however , has always been an important enterprise for psychologists working in correctional settings . reliable offender classification was both an important service to offer to correctional administrators and in many respects a prerequisite to effective treatment . in both the united states and canada , from the twentyd20th century on , psychologists became increasingly involved in developing and testing more sophisticated classification systems . one of the earliest of these  modern  systems was the jesness classification system . best known , however , was the system proposed by edwin megargee and based on the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory . megargee , using his research on overcontrolled and undercontrolled personalities as a springboard , identified ten  inmate types.  prison officials then made use of these groupings to assign inmates to custody levels , job assignments , and rehabilitation programs . megargee system is still in use in some prison systems , and clements observed that megargee deserves much credit for providing correctional psychologists with an excellent list of seven criteria for a good classification system . in the nineteen sixties and early nineteen seventies , correctional psychology as a subdiscipline of forensic psychology began to expand . even to this day , though , many if not most psychologists working in corrections prefer to be called correctional psychologists rather than forensic psychologists . this may be because they see their primary function as one of providing services to inmates , not to the legal system . until the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies , although there were exceptions , psychologists in correctional facilities focused more on classification than on treatment , although important treatment models were proposed by psychologists such as herbert quay and marguerite warren . nevertheless , treatment was not the predominant activity , both because the demand for diagnostic services was great and the obstacles relative to respecting confidentiality and achieving the trust of inmates were difficult to surmount . perhaps even more relevant was the suspicion directed toward psychologists by both administrative and correctional staffs . in an essay reviewing this period in the history of correctional psychology , brodsky cited examples of military psychologists being given punitive assignments or civilian psychologists being obstructed from providing meaningful treatment services to inmates in some cases even reporting for work to find themselves no longer employed , their possessions waiting for them at the prison gate .  with the exception of psychologists in the federal bureau of prisons , psychologists working in american prisons reported organizational impediments to conducting meaningful assessments and offering meaningful treatment  . in the nineteen sixties , rehabilitation as a correctional goal began to gain favor , and in some but certainly not all prison settings psychologists spent more time working directly with offenders and providing treatment services . although positions were plentiful , the turnover rate was high , primarily because psychologists often had not received adequate preparation for responding to the unique challenges of these environments . one noteworthy innovation that was introduced in federal prisons during this era was the unit management system , which was initially conceptualized by daniel glaser and later promoted by robert levinson . unit management divided prison populations into small groups of prisoners and staff members based on the programming needs of the former and the expertise of the latter . some units those in which more intensive treatment services could be provided became  therapeutic communities.  other units provided education , training , or work experiences , together with some counseling . although unit management lost support in the united states during the punitive nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties , the concept survives in some state and federal facilities , particularly where substance abuse treatment is provided . many correctional psychologists worked in the trenches during the nineteen sixties and early nineteen seventies and made significant contributions . stanley brodsky was instrumental in launching modern correctional psychology in the united states , but many other individuals made significant contributions as well . canada has its own group of pioneers who have had great impact on correctional philosophy and practice on an international level . they include psychologists paul gendreau , karl hanson , don andrews , and many others whose work is cited in the excellent historical reviews and summaries of watkins and wormith and luong . in the united states , brodsky term as president of the american association for correctional psychology helped provide the impetus to move correctional psychology into a recognized and viable profession . during one thousand, nine hundred and seventy two and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy three , with brodsky at the helm , the aacp played a key role in setting up a series of conferences on psychology in the criminal justice system , with emphasis on corrections . the proceedings were published in a volume edited by brodsky , psychologists in the criminal justice system . the publication of this influential book could arguably be the official launch date of modern correctional psychology , even though the aacp itself predated brodsky book . brodsky also became the founding editor of the international journal criminal justice and behavior , launched in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy four and sponsored by the aacp . brodsky leadership and enthusiasm also helped build one of the earliest doctoral programs specifically designed to prepare clinical psychologists to work in the criminal justice system , particularly corrections , at the university of alabama . in the late nineteen seventies , the apa approved a clinical internship in corrections at the wisconsin department of corrections . today , such programs exist in a variety of colleges and universities , many of which provide internship opportunities for students in state prisons as well as the federal bureau of prisons . those who prefer a narrow definition of forensic psychology do not typically include police psychology in its purview . we have done so because police are sworn to uphold the law and are in many cases the gatekeepers to entry into criminal and juvenile courts , if not civil courts . thus , psychologists who consult with police in numerous capacities are connected with the legal system . it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when police psychology began , primarily because individual psychologists have provided a variety of services to law enforcement without their work being formally recognized . viteles noted that police departments in germany used psychologists in a variety of capacities as early as one thousand, nine hundred and nineteen. in the united states , in keeping with the psychometric movement of the early twentieth century , contributions centered around assessment , particularly cognitive assessment administered to candidates for law enforcement positions . four discernible but overlapping historical trends in american police psychology can be identified : cognitive and aptitude screening , personality assessment and the search for the  police personality ,  stress management and other clinical services , and fairness in screening and selection . the first trend one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen to one thousand, nine hundred and sixty is characterized by attempts of psychologists to assess the intellectual skills required to be an effective police officer . the second trend one thousand, nine hundred and fifty two to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy five focused on the development of personality measures capable of distinguishing effective from less effective officers . during the second trend , there also were many unsuccessful attempts to identify a  police personality.  the third trend one thousand, nine hundred and seventy four to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four was characterized by psychologists becoming increasingly involved in the identification and treatment of stress and other emotional reactions often experienced by police officers and their loved ones . such topics of interest included the use of excessive force , police decision making , postshooting traumatic reaction , fitness for duty evaluations , and police suicide . the fourth trend one thousand, nine hundred and eighty to the present refers to the legal requirements that all persons should have an equal chance of being selected on the basis of individual merit and qualifications . topics during this trend include the americans with disabilities act of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety , gender issues in policing , and minority composition, ethnic composition, racial composition of law enforcement agencies . because this chapter focuses on early history , we briefly sketch only the first two trends . it should be noted , however , that police psychologists today are actively involved in consultation with law enforcement and with research in a variety of areas that reflect and transcend the above trends . many belong to professional organizations , such as the apa division eighteen , psychologists in public service and its subgroup police and public safety . lewis terman was the first american psychologist to use  mental tests  as screening devices in the selection of law enforcement personnel . on october thirty one , one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen , at the request of the city manager of san jose , california , he administered an abbreviated form of the stanfordbinet to thirty police and fire department applicants . they ranged in age from twenty one to thirty eight , with a median age of thirty. only four had attended high school , and none had attended beyond the sophomore year . terman found that most of the applicants functioned near the dullnormal range of intelligence ; only three obtained an iq over one hundred , the score considered average for the general population . based on his experience with the intellectual capabilities of schoolage children , terman suggested , somewhat arbitrarily , that applicants with an iq under eighty were not fit for police work or firefighting . the city manager agreed , and ten applicants were immediately excluded from further consideration . a contemporary of terman , psychologist louis thurstone , was also interested in the value of intellectual testing in police screening . thurstone administered the newly developed army intelligence examination to three hundred and fifty eight male members of the detroit police department . the army alpha , developed by robert yerkes , e. l. thorndike , and lewis terman and adopted by the u.s. army in one thousand, nine hundred and seventeen , was probably the first exclusively american test of intelligence . police officers at all ranks scored below average on the army alpha ; in fact , the more experienced the police officer , the lower was his intelligence score . the average score for the three hundred and seven patrol officers was seventy one ; the sergeants averaged fifty four ; and the seventeen lieutenants , fifty seven . thurstone concluded that law enforcement did not attract intelligent individuals , and the more intelligent individuals who entered police service left for other occupations where their abilities and intelligence were better utilized . law enforcement officers were vindicated somewhat , however , when maude a. merrill administered the army alpha to a group of already employed officers and applicants . they scored at the average level . the differences between her findings and those of terman and thurstone were probably due to department leadership factors , recruitment procedures , and selection ratios . intelligence testing continued throughout much of the middle part of the twentieth century and may still exist in some departments today . however , questions about the validity of such assessment and understandable resistance from police unions persuaded most agencies to turn to a different form of assessment , the personality assessment . in the years between the two world wars , psychologists gradually became more involved in the screening of law enforcement personnel and began to incorporate personality assessment into that enterprise . wilmington , delaware , and toledo , ohio , appear to share the distinction of being the first two cities to require ongoing psychological screening for use in police selection , in the form of mental and personality tests . the year was one thousand, nine hundred and thirty eight. thus , personality tests came on the scene at about this time . it was not until the late nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties , though , that personality assessment overtook cognitive tests in the screening of law enforcement personnel . while the aforementioned psychologists were among the first to study the cognitive capacities of police officers and candidates , there is no indication that they consistently participated in the screening and selection of law enforcement personnel . at this point , we have no information about who might have been the first psychologist to assume this regular role . as late as one thousand, nine hundred and thirty nine , donald paterson could identify only one psychologist , l. j. o ’ rourke , who had actively investigated the validity of the nation civil service examination system , even though routine competitive exams were administered as far back as one thousand, eight hundred and eighty three. during the late nineteen forties and the nineteen fifties , psychologists continued to consult with police departments . the psychological screening processes initiated by the wilmington and toledo police departments was adopted by other cities ; jacksonville in one thousand, nine hundred and forty seven , berkeley in one thousand, nine hundred and forty nine , oakland in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty , new orleans in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty two , and pasadena , philadelphia , milwaukee , and cleveland in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty three . in june one thousand, nine hundred and fifty two , the los angeles police department began to administer a battery of psychological tests . the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty seven rankin article was the first to appear in the literature attesting to any ongoing program of psychological assessment for police applicants . during the late nineteen sixties , personality assessment , psychological screening , and police psychology in general received an immense boost when the president commission on law enforcement and the administration of justice strongly recommended widespread use of psychological measures to determine the emotional stability of all officer candidates . this recommendation was followed by the strong endorsement in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty eight by the national advisory commission on civil disorder that psychological screening would improve the emotional quality of individuals entering law enforcement . in keeping with commission recommendations , congress provided law enforcement assistance administration funds for law enforcement agencies to retain the services of mental health professionals . in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy three , the police task force report of the national commission on criminal justice standards and goals encouraged the establishment of a behavioral sciences unit or consultant for all law enforcement agencies . even before then , though , psychologists were offering services to law enforcement on an asneeded basis , consulting in such areas as stress management , crisis management with the mentally disordered , and domestic violence . according to nietzel , the first project to train police in crisis intervention techniques in domestic disputes was developed in the late nineteen sixties by morton bard , consulting with the new york city police department . at about the same time , in december one thousand, nine hundred and sixty eight , martin reiser was hired by the los angeles police department as a fulltime police psychologist . the evidence to date indicates that reiser was the first fulltime psychologist whose responsibilities were strictly police related . reiser himself is not entirely certain he was the first fulltime police psychologist in the country . in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty nine , he presented a paper at the western psychological association convention in vancouver entitled  the police department psychologist.  this presentation may represent the  official  launch of contemporary north american police psychology . the paper was published in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy two. reiser continued to be the most prolific writer on police psychology during the early nineteen seventies . in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy two , in cooperation with the california school of professional psychology and the los angeles police department , he helped establish what is believed to be the first clinical internship in police psychology in the united states . by one thousand, nine hundred and seventy seven , at least six other law enforcement agencies employed fulltime psychologists . in the early years of the twentieth century , psychologists began to offer psychological perspectives on criminal behavior and to speculate about the causes of crime . like the police psychology discussed earlier , criminal psychology typically is not considered in the narrow definitions of forensic psychology , primarily because it appears more theoretical than clinical in nature . however , in its youth , criminal psychology was essentially clinical in nature , as the theories often centered on the measurable mental capacities of offenders . furthermore , forensic psychology devoid of a theoretical base such as that provided by criminal psychology is difficult to justify and support . psychologists like goddard had repeatedly found that most juvenile and adult offenders were  mentally deficient ,  which led to the conclusion that a primary  cause  of crime and delinquency was intellectual limitation . in large part , this belief reflected the pervasive influence of darwinism , which contended that humans differ only in degree from their animal brethren . the  mentally deficient  were considered both intellectually and morally less capable of adapting to modern society . they presumably resorted to more  primitive  ways of meeting their needs , such as crime . these unfortunate conclusions , which did not take into account social conditions , cultural differences , or socialization processes , lent support to unconscionable practices such as lengthy incarceration of the disadvantaged , confused , and powerless . in the history of psychology , few scholars have ventured to offer comprehensive theories on crime or delinquent behavior . those who have have often been strongly influenced by darwinian thinking . therefore , theoretical orientations focusing on mental deficiency or biological and constitutional dispositions dominated early psychological criminology . in the early nineteen sixties , a psychological criminology distinct from psychiatric and more extensive than psychometrics began to show signs of life . hans toch , who was also making significant contributions to correctional psychology , edited one of the first books on psychological criminology , legal and criminal psychology . some may argue that hans gross published the first criminal psychology book in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety seven , the same year in which he was appointed professor in ordinary for criminal law and justice administration at the university of czernowitz in austria . one writer has asserted that gross was the originator of the discipline of criminal psychology . however , gross was a lawyer by training , in practice , and in spirit and eventually became a successful judge . his book details his observations of offenders , witnesses , jurors , and judges but relies very little on psychological research . this is not surprising , of course , because psychology in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety seven was far from being an integrated discipline with a rich body of knowledge . nevertheless , it is significant that toch book , published more than sixty years later , represents the earliest attempt to integrate , in an interdisciplinary fashion , the empirical research of psychologists relevant to criminal behavior and legal issues . british psychologist hans j. eysenck , in crime and personality , formulated the first comprehensive theoretical statement on criminal behavior advanced by a psychologist . eysenck theory focused on the personality characteristics of extraversion and introversion , which he believed could be attributed to both a biological predisposition to seek or avoid sensation and the learning experiences obtained in one social environment . although eysenck theory was circulated and tested extensively in the late nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies , it has been shifted aside today , replaced by popular developmental approaches . shortly after eysenck proposed his theory , edwin megargee put forth his own heuristic statements regarding undercontrolled and overcontrolled personalities and their relationships to violence , a theory that then served as a basis for his classification system referred to earlier . toch followed with violent men . the relationship between aggression and violence was studied seriously under the leadership of leonard berkowitz , albert bandura , and later robert baron . following psychiatrist hervey cleckley groundbreaking work on psychopaths , they became subjects of vigorous theory building and research in the hands of canadian psychologist robert hare and others . psychopathy continues to be a rich research area on the etiology of criminal behavior to this day . since the nineteen seventies , we have witnessed a literature and research explosion in all areas of forensic psychology . some thirty years ago , loh observed that forensic psychology had  come of age.  most recently , heilbrun and brooks noted that  he field has matured : the recognition of the importance of the foundational science is stronger , and we are closer to identifying best practices across a range of legal contexts that are addressed by forensic psychology research and practice  . in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty five , just over one hundred englishlanguage articles and books related to forensic psychology had been published . by the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy970s , the numbers were well into the thousands . professional journals exclusively devoted to forensic psychological research and issues were beginning to emerge in north america . criminal justice and behavior led the way in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy four , followed by law and psychology review beginning in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy five , law and human behavior in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy seven , behavioral sciences and the law in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty two , and psychology , public policy , and law in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five. great britain followed suit with criminal behavior and mental health , psychology , crime , and law , the british psychological society legal and criminological psychology , and the journal of forensic psychology practice . in addition to these , other interdisciplinary scholarly and scientific journals relevant to forensic psychology have emerged in recent years . during the nineteen seventies , interdisciplinary and specialized training in forensic psychology was introduced at the doctoral , master , internship , postdoctoral , and continuing education levels . the first interdisciplinary , successful psychology and law program was developed by bruce sales at the university of nebraska–lincoln in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy four . other universities soon followed in this endeavor , some more successfully than others . in the late twentieth century and into twenty first , thoughtful articles addressing the content of education and training programs in forensic psychology have been published . another indication of the growth in forensic psychology is professional certification of practitioners in the field , a development that began in the late nineteen seventies . beginning in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy eight , board certification in forensic psychology was provided by the american board of forensic psychology . in recent years , other board certifications have emerged , such as the american board of forensic examiners . in two thousand and one , as noted earlier , the apa voted to recognize forensic psychology as a specialty , and specialty guidelines for forensic psychologists and psychology were adopted in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety one and two thousand and eleven , respectively . forensic psychology has seen a rapid expansion in other parts of the globe besides north america , particularly in europe and australia . blackburn , in the first issue of legal and criminological psychology , asserted ,  the growth in the number of forensic psychologists has been among the most prominent developments in the burgeoning application of psychology to law during the last two decades  . he noted that , although the growth was most apparent in the united states , there was a parallel growth throughout europe in the latter part of the twentieth century . after an uncertain beginning and some stagnation between the two world wars , forensic psychology is now well established . despite some continuing concerns about its definition , it is importantly clinical in nature but also critically dependent on theory and research . all indicators suggest that forensic psychology has an extremely promising future as we continue into the twenty first century . in the following chapters , other contributors assess forensic psychology current status and the promise it holds for a future generation of researchers , practicing psychologists , theorists , and legal practitioners .

Or, in a child abuse prosecution, a psychologist knowledgeable about sexual victimization of children might educate the jury about why child victims of sexual abuse do not always come forward immediately to report the abuse or identify the perpetrator (Bussey, Lee, & Grimbeck, 1993; Kuehnle & Connell, 2009; 2012).  Social authority testimony is also introduced in legislative hearings, to inform lawmakers about psychological phenomena that are relevant to pending legislation. Thus, a psychologist knowledgeable about limitations in how adolescents under-stand and exercise their constitutional rights while in custody might testify before a legislative body that is considering a law mandating that minors be appointed counsel in delinquency proceedings, whereas a psychologist knowledgeable about the relationship between watching violence on television and aggressive behavior of children might offer expert testimony to a body considering legislation limiting what is broadcast on television during daytime hours.'"

       "'defining forensic psychology . there is no consensual definition of forensic psychology . perhaps it is surprising , given the relatively long history and growth of forensic psychology over the past forty years , that there is no uniform or consensual definition for this specialty area , and most differences involve how narrowly or broadly the field is defined . definitions range from expansive ones that include any application of psychology to any legal matters to those that are narrower and typically are limited to clinical and counseling psychologists ’ involvement in legal matters as examiners , treatment providers , or consultants . examples of more expansive definitions include those offered by huss , who defined forensic psychology as  any application of psychology to the legal system  ; the american psychological association , which in its specialty guidelines for forensic psychology indicated that  forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any subdiscipline of psychology when applying the scientific , technical , or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal , contractual , and administrative matters  ; and the american board of forensic psychology , which described forensic psychology as  the application of the science and profession of psychology to questions and issues relating to law and the legal system  . in contrast , in its petition to the apa committee for the recognition of specialties and proficiencies in professional psychology to establish forensic psychology as a psychological specialty , the forensic specialty council offered a more narrow definition :  forensic psychology is the professional practice by psychologists within the areas of clinical psychology , counseling psychology , school psychology or another specialty recognized by the american psychological association , when they are engaged as experts and represent themselves as such , in an activity primarily intended to provide professional psychological expertise to the judicial system  . brigham observed that these differences are more than semantic , and the varying definitions have distinct advantages and disadvantages . whereas adopting a broad definition , according to brigham , could promote growth and coherence in the field and facilitate development of graduate training programs , he acknowledged that grouping clinical psychologists with nonclinicians could prove complicated and perhaps problematic given the very different training and licensure requirements that often apply . indeed , brigham reported that disagreement among members of apls about how broad or narrow the definition should be initially led the group to abandon a cooperative effort with the american academy of forensic psychology to jointly sponsor a petition to have apa formally recognize forensic psychology as a specialty . adding to the confusion , how the terms forensic psychology or psychology and law are defined differs internationally . conventionally , the entire field including both clinical or applied areas and research areas has been referred to as psychology and law or law and psychology in north america and continental europe , whereas the term forensic psychology has been more commonly employed in the united kingdom , australia , and new zealand . in countries that use the term forensic psychology in an expansive way , those who work in the applied areas of psychology and the law typically are referred to as clinical forensic psychologists . regardless of the differences that exist concerning the definition of forensic psychology , it is uniformly agreed that forensic psychology involves the application of psychological knowledge and expertise to the legal system . to this end , forensic psychologists work at the interface of psychology and the law . as forensic psychologists work with legal actors , including attorneys , judges , and others in the justice system , a number of tensions exist . although commentators have characterized these tensions differently , a number of common themes emerge . drawing on the framework provided by haney , we present eight differences between psychology and law that may contribute to tensions between the disciplines.the emphasis in law is stare decisis , whereas in psychology the emphasis is on creativity . in the law , past cases and matters such as constitutional interpretation rather than innovation or creativity are painstakingly relied on for the development of legal arguments . the model adopted in law is one of legal precedent . in contrast , in psychology , the model is one of innovation , and psychologists , in both research and applied work , are encouraged continually to explore new ideas and methods.law is hierarchical whereas psychology is empirical . decisions within the legal system are hierarchically based and authoritative , with lower courts bound by the decisions of higher courts . in psychology , however , it is the accumulation of a body of consistent and supporting data that confirms the validity of a particular position or claim , not its authoritative declaration.law relies on the adversarial method , whereas psychology relies on the experimental method . the law seeks  justice ,  which equates to procedural fairness . it is hoped that just procedures will assist in arriving at the truth ; however , knowing that the truth is elusive , it is seen as more important to ensure that the principles of due process are followed . to arrive at the  truth  in law , conflicting points of view are presented within the strict parameters of a trial or appellate hearing , with each side putting its best case forward . bias , selfinterest , and advocacy are not only permitted but heralded as one of the strengths of the process . indeed , what is of immediate concern and the driving force for the opposing lawyers is victory . psychology , in contrast to law , attempts to arrive at  truth  ’ using a variety of diverse datagathering methods . common to all of these methods is the systematic collection of data , using procedures that attempt to  reduce bias , error and distortion in observation and inferences  . although this is not to say that bias does not enter into the research process , the goal of the psychologist is to attain an  objective  understanding of the phenomena rather than victory over a particular viewpoint . law is prescriptive , whereas psychology is descriptive . the law is primarily prescriptive , telling  people how they should behave ,  whereas psychology is  essentially a descriptive discipline , seeking to describe behavior as it actually occurs  . this dimension captures a difference in the values espoused in the disciplines , with law outlining how one ought to behave and psychology adopting a more nonjudgmental orientation of how people do behave . law is idiographic , whereas psychology is nomothetic . law operates on a case-by-case basis , with each case decided on the basis of its specific facts . in contrast , psychology is interested in uncovering the general principles , relationships , and patterns that govern human behavior . the focus in psychology is not on a particular instance but rather on what transcends the particular instance . decision making in law is based on the appearance of certainty , whereas decision making in psychology is based on probabilistic evidence . the decisions made in the law typically take on a dichotomous , all-or-nothing quality the accused in a criminal trial is deemed either guilty or not guilty , the defendant in a civil case is found liable or not liable . psychologists , in contrast , operate in terms of probabilities ; for example , claims are asserted on the basis of evidence associated with a probability level . as a result , conclusions drawn by psychologists typically are qualified and not categorical by nature.law is reactive , whereas psychology is proactive . the issues that arise in the law originate from outside the system , namely , cases are brought to the attention of lawyers . in contrast , psychologists , notwithstanding the presence of various external pressures , have considerable control over the issues they study . law is operational , whereas psychology is academic . law is an applied discipline , and it is designed to deal with realworld problems . the players within the system have clearly defined roles that prescribe the issues on which they will concentrate . in contrast , similar to the distinction noted previously , psychologists have considerable say over the issues they pursue . the driving force tends to be more of a quest for knowledge for its own sake .with these eight tensions in mind , included in what follows is an expansive survey of what can be characterized as forensic psychology . at a macro level , forensic psychologists can assist the legal system in four ways : providing legal decision makers with information about complicated matters that they would not otherwise have , assisting specific legal actors , researching the legal system and its operation , and researching psychological phenomena that are of particular interest or relevance to the legal system . psychologists assisting the legal system . psychologists assist the legal system in a number of ways including providing expert testimony in legal , administrative , and legislative proceedings ; conducting and testifying about research conducted in anticipation of litigation ; testifying about research not conducted in connection with litigation but that is nonetheless relevant ; and researching the legal system operation.every day in the united states and other countries , thousands of psychologists appear before and provide expert opinions to courts , administrative proceedings , attorneys , and legislative hearings via reports and/or sworn testimony . psychologists ’ involvement in these matters is predicated on the assumption that their observations and opinions will educate the recipient about some psychological phenomena that are relevant to the legal matters in dispute , and , as a result , a more accurate and presumably better decision will be made.psychologists ’ participation in this way is based on the premise that , in some cases , legal decision makers must consider complicated psychological matters that are beyond their understanding , and their judgments would benefit from the insights and opinions of someone with specialized knowledge about the matter , such as a psychologist . indeed , federal rule of evidence seven hundred and two makes clear under what circumstances psychologists are permitted to testify : a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge , skill , experience , training , or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if : the expert scientific , technical , or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue ; the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data ; the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods ; and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case . conducting and testifying about forensic psychological evaluations . most frequently , psychologists provide assistance to the legal system by offering observations and opinions about the emotional , behavioral , and/or cognitive functioning of someone whose mental state is at issue in a legal proceeding . these activities are quite varied and range from involvement in criminal proceedings in which the competence of a defendant to stand trial is in dispute to civil proceedings in which the court is faced with making decisions about what type of living and legal arrangements would be in a child best interests in the case of divorcing parents who can not reach an agreement about these matters . in these cases , psychologists are offering observations and opinions about a specific person who has been evaluated , and these observations and opinions are considered helpful to the court . because a defendant , litigant , or other person emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning can be at issue in a variety of legal proceedings , psychologists find themselves evaluating and testifying about the functioning of persons in many different legal matters . in criminal proceedings , psychologists may evaluate defendants when there are questions about their competence to proceed , criminal responsibility , and/or treatment needs for consideration at the time of sentencing . in civil proceedings , psychologists can evaluate litigants and others when there are questions about their capacity to parent , manage their personal and financial affairs , execute a will , work , or make healthcare decisions , or when there are disputes about their emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning as it relates to their risk for harming themselves or others or an alleged wrong committed by a third party . in all of these cases , psychologists assess individuals in light of the parameters the law has established for the particular question being addressed in order to gather data and offer opinions that will be presented to the decision makers to assist them in reaching a more informed decision in the matter .in some cases , psychologists can be of assistance to attorneys and the court by conducting and presenting the results of research that addresses important points of contention in litigation . although the kind of questions that are asked and the type of research that is conducted can vary dramatically , common to this work is that the research was conducted in the context of the litigation at hand and designed to answer some casespecific questions.in their influential treatise , walker and monahan described the products of this research as  social fact  testimony . for example , often in dispute in patent and trademark litigation is the issue of consumer confusion about competing products . in these cases , such as recent legal disputes regarding the apple and samsung wireless phones , one company alleges that another is unfairly encroaching on a unique aspect of its product that results in consumer confusion and/or harms the company economically . in zippo manufacturing v. rogers imports , the zippo lighter company argued that a competitor rogers imports copied the design of its cigarette lighter in such a way that it violated its trademark , caused consumers to confuse the two brands , and resulted in decreased zippo sales and income . in support of its claim , zippo presented results of research conducted expressly for purposes of the litigation , in which participants who were presented with both lighters demonstrated confusion about the brands . the results and interpretation of these data were offered by zippo manufacturing in support of its ultimately successful claim that consumer confusion resulted from the trademarked design similarities . psychologists also conduct research to inform legal decision makers about the knowledge and attitudes members of a jury pool have about a case that is about to go to trial , so as to inform decisions about whether an unbiased jury can be empaneled or whether a change in venue is necessary . such jury venire research , which is conducted in both criminal and civil proceedings , involves developing and administering surveys that query potential members of the jury pool about their knowledge and attitudes concerning the case at hand . psychologists who conduct this research may be called to testify about their findings , thereby providing the court with information about the jury pool that it would not otherwise have , to allow it to make a more informed decision about potential jurors ’ knowledge of case matters and the potential need for a change in venue.psychologists can also assist legal decision makers and legislative bodies by providing observations and expert opinions about more general matters that are nonetheless of interest to the court or legislature . walker and monahan referred to this as  social authority  testimony . in litigation contexts , psychologists typically testify about research that sheds light on some matter or an assumption that is relevant to the case at hand , but they typically do not offer opinions about specific case matters . for example , a psychologist knowledgeable about research regarding eyewitnesses might be called to testify and educate a jury in a criminal proceeding about the poor relationship between eyewitness confidence and eyewitness accuracy , or how crime witnesses tend to focus on weapons that are brandished and pay less attention to the perpetrator and his or her appearance . or , in a child abuse prosecution , a psychologist knowledgeable about sexual victimization of children might educate the jury about why child victims of sexual abuse do not always come forward immediately to report the abuse or identify the perpetrator . social authority testimony is also introduced in legislative hearings , to inform lawmakers about psychological phenomena that are relevant to pending legislation . thus , a psychologist knowledgeable about limitations in how adolescents understand and exercise their constitutional rights while in custody might testify before a legislative body that is considering a law mandating that minors be appointed counsel in delinquency proceedings , whereas a psychologist knowledgeable about the relationship between watching violence on television and aggressive behavior of children might offer expert testimony to a body considering legislation limiting what is broadcast on television during daytime hours . psychologists conduct research that examines the legal system and its operation , and their findings can provide direction that is of considerable value . this research is quite varied in nature and focuses on phenomena as disparate as the effectiveness of various legal interventions or programs , the prevalence and characteristics of various phenomena , and the operation of the legal system more generally . what unifies this type of research is its focus on understanding and improving the legal system and its potential to provide important information to those who fashion policy and make laws that shape the legal system and its operation.as an example , in their program of research , redlich and her colleagues have examined the outcomes associated with special  mental health courts  designed to respond to criminal defendants whose involvement with the criminal justice system is related to their problems with severe and persistent mental illness . peters and his colleagues , in a similar line of research , examined the efficacy of courts devoted to managing the special challenges of offenders with substance abuse problems . finally , in a very different line of research , kovera and her colleagues examined the impact of expert testimony on the legal decision making of judges and jurors . as the information just presented demonstrates , the roles of forensic psychologists in these contexts can be broad and varied . at a micro level , their work can involve conducting and reporting the results of psychological assessments or conducting casespecific research , both with the intent of providing caserelevant knowledge to the legal decision maker that it would not otherwise have , so that more informed and better decisions are made . at the other end of the spectrum the macro level psychologists can help policy makers , legislators , and decision makers better understand the need for or potential impact of proposed legislation or the legal system and its operation . common to their involvement in all matters , however , is the fact that psychologists are relying on their expertise to provide helpful information that would otherwise not be available to legal decision makers . we turn next to a discussion of the role that forensic psychologists play in assisting specific legal actors . given that forensic psychology involves the application of psychology to the legal system , it is not surprising that much of the work of forensic psychologists involves assisting specific legal actors . in this section , we discuss the different ways in which forensic psychologists may assist law enforcement agencies , attorneys , litigants , and others . within the area of policing and law enforcement , psychologists may play a variety of roles . a large body of research exists that establishes psychologists ’ potential to assess law enforcement officers in matters of investigation and interrogation . once a crime is reported , law enforcement officials conduct an investigation to establish whether a crime has in fact been committed , whether it can be solved , and whether they can obtain evidence to facilitate a prosecution . at the level of investigation , a number of popular books , television shows , and movies depict criminal profilers . james brussel , a psychiatrist who began consulting to the new york city police department in the nineteen fifties , described the first case in which he was asked to assist the police . the  mad bomber of new york  detonated more than twenty bombs in theaters , transportation terminals , libraries , and offices around new york city for sixteen years during the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties . despite notes and letters mailed to them by the bomber , the police were at a loss to identify a suspect and eventually consulted brussel , who examined the evidence the police had collected , including the notes , letters , and photographs and details of the crime scenes . brussel developed a precise  criminal profile  of the bomber , which turned out to closely match the characteristics of the man the police eventually apprehended and prosecuted . since that time , the field of criminal profiling has developed . of course , in many cases , the efforts of psychologists and psychiatrists have not been so successful , and there remains concern that criminal profiling is nothing more than socalled smoke and mirrors . in reality , most criminal profilers are police officers , but forensic psychologists sometimes are called on to assist with investigations . over time , investigative psychology and offender profiling have developed into an area of forensic psychology with an empirical base , and modern approaches to offender profiling are far removed from the early speculative approaches that are still so often depicted in television and film . psychologists have also conducted research to investigate the efficacy of police interviews and assist police with interviewing witnesses and suspects , including child victims and witnesses . this work assists police in developing interviewing skills for use with witnesses and suspects that will maximize the amount of accurate information that is obtained and minimize bias and error . in addition to direct involvement with police with respect to conducting investigations and questioning witnesses and suspects , psychologists are involved in a range of other activities . psychologists may be called on to assist the police in their interactions with persons with mental disorders . a great deal of work has also been done to assist law enforcement agencies with respect to screening , selection , and recruitment of police candidates and providing critical mental health services to sworn officers and their families . we now turn to a brief review of the roles psychologists play in assisting attorneys.psychologists frequently provide consultation to attorneys with respect to case formulation and jury matters . to this end , some psychologists assist attorneys in conceptualizing and presenting cases in a way that will be most advantageous to their clients . moreover , a growing area of study focuses on the psychology of the jury , in which psychologists assist attorneys by developing strategies for selecting and working with juries . indeed , the area of psychological trial consulting and scientific jury selection has grown significantly over the past two decades . psychologists can assist attorneys by helping them conceptualize their case in a way that will be most compelling for the jury . trial consultants argue that , because attorneys develop specialized legal knowledge , they may not be able to conceptualize cases or present them in a way that will be best understood by the jury . research shows that jurors use a socalled story model to assist them to make sense of the facts presented at trial . according to this model , after hearing the evidence at trial and being provided the legal instructions by the judge at the end of the trial , jurors attempt to find the best match between the arguments made by the competing attorneys and the verdict options . to this end , it is important that attorneys conceptualize and explain the case in a way that the jury understands and that will best fit the verdict option that suits their clients . relying on general decisionmaking research and surveys or questionnaires that may be developed for the case at hand , psychologists can assist attorneys by helping them understand how jurors may make sense of and consider the evidence and crafting their arguments accordingly . more recently , psychologists acting as trial consultants have begun to assist attorneys in presenting the information to the jury using modern technology to maximize the effectiveness of their arguments . beyond assisting attorneys in conceptualizing the case and presenting information to jurors in the most compelling manner , psychologists may assist attorneys with jury selection . in the united states , the jury is selected in a process known as the voir dire , during which potential jurors are questioned by the judge or attorneys in order to ensure that a fair and impartial jury is empaneled . as such , jurors may be  challenged for cause  in cases where it is determined that a juror has preexisting beliefs that would prevent him or her from making a decision in the case based solely on the evidence presented . in addition to challenges for cause , attorneys may challenge a designated number of prospective jurors in each case without providing a justification . with peremptory challenges , prospective jurors may be excluded  without a reason stated , without inquiry , and without being subject to the court control  . when empaneling a jury , attorneys may rely on forensic psychologists to assist them in selecting the most desirable jurors and deselecting the least desirable jurors . typically , psychologists survey members of the community about matters pertaining to a case in order to identify those characteristics that relate attitudes about the case and case outcomes . consultants may also use focus groups to obtain additional information about the views of people regarding matters at issue in the particular case and how prospective jurors may respond to different arguments . based on the results of the surveys , psychologists can help identify the characteristics of people who would be more or less likely to make a decision in favor of their client . then , during voir dire , potential jurors would be asked a series of questions designed to identify sympathetic and unsympathetic jurors . research shows that , without assistance , attorneys may not be very skilled at identifying jurors who might be biased against their clients . although the empirical evidence shows an increased likelihood that jurors will find in favor of the side that employs jury consultants , the results vary across studies and in actual cases particularly since both sides may use consultants . in addition to the strategies just outlined , psychologists who work as jury consultants sometimes employ mock or shadow juries . the use of mock juries involves bringing a group of jury eligible people together , presenting them with case information in order to determine how various arguments and presentations affect their thinking and decision making , and shaping the case presentation accordingly . the complexity and sophistication of mock juries can vary from providing the participants with a summary of information about the case to actually having attorneys present their arguments in a mock trial format . finally , during the course of the trial , jury consultants sometimes employ  shadow jurors  who sit in the courtroom throughout the trial , listen to the arguments and evidence , and provide the consultant with their perceptions and opinions as the trial proceeds . the attorneys then use this information to shape their subsequent presentations and strategies .assisting litigants and others . with respect to assisting litigants and others in the legal system , psychologists act in quasijudicial capacities and also provide therapeutic services . quasijudicial roles . over the past quarter of a century , psychologists have become increasingly involved in a number of activities in which they serve as decision makers for persons involved in the legal process . psychologists ’ involvement in such activities is presumably predicated upon assumptions that their interpersonal skills provide them with abilities that will facilitate examination and settling of disputes . a number of these activities are presented next . mediation . in some jurisdictions , psychologists can serve as legally recognized mediators , in which they function in a quasijudicial role . mediation is a dispute resolution process that helps persons involved in legal disputes avoid the adversarial process and courtroom litigation . although there is considerable variability across jurisdictions and contexts , mediation at the most general level involves a neutral person who works with parties to a dispute in order to craft an agreement that is acceptable to them , with the understanding that a return to traditional litigation channels will occur if such an agreement can not be reached . unlike many if not most litigants , parents in custody disputes must have continued contact with each other involving matters of their minor children after the court hearing their dispute has rendered a judgment . thus , mediation proponents argue that it can be of particular value in divorce and custody proceedings because of its potential to diminish some of the acrimony and emotion that is associated with the adversarial process . proponents of using mediation in cases of contested custody argue that it has the potential to facilitate settlement of a large number of cases headed for court , speed litigation times , decrease litigation costs , increase compliance with custody agreements , and improve family relationships , including the relationship that the divorcing or separating parents have with each other and their children . some , however , have questioned the value of mediation in matters of divorce and custody . in two thousand and five , the afcc an interdisciplinary organization of attorneys , mental health professionals , social service professionals , and accountants published the model standards of practice for family and divorce mediation , which serve as a guide for the conduct of family mediators , educate service recipients about the mediation process and what to expect , and promote public confidence in mediation as a family dispute resolution process . parent coordination . over the past fifteen to twenty years , psychologists and other mental health professionals have taken on a new role in family court proceedings of parent coordinator or special master . according to the apa , parent coordination is a nonadversarial dispute resolution process that is court ordered or agreed on by divorced and separated parents who have an ongoing pattern of high conflict and/or litigation about their children . . . is designed to help parents implement and comply with court orders or parenting plans , to make timely decisions in a manner consistent with children developmental and psychological needs , to reduce the amount of damaging conflict between caretaking adults to which children are exposed , and to diminish the pattern of unnecessary relitigation about childrelated issues . parent coordinators typically are appointed only in the most challenging cases involving divorced parents who experience enduring high conflict surrounding the caretaking of their children . parent coordinators generally have responsibility for resolving ongoing and day-to-day disputes that may develop , while the court retains the right to rule on more significant matters . all commentators agree that serving as a parent coordinator is particularly challenging , given the level of conflict that is inherent to all cases , the hybrid role that is assumed by the professional , and the myriad regulatory and professional bodies that might consider the work of the professional . not surprisingly , the legal authority for parent coordinators , their rights , and their responsibilities varies across jurisdictions . recently , however , at least two organizations have provided important direction to psychologists serving in this role by publishing practice guidelines . in two thousand and five , the afcc published the guidelines for parenting coordination , the purpose of which is to provide direction to professionals , jurisdictions , and educational institutions regarding appropriate parent coordinator practice ; the parent coordinator ethical obligations ; and educational , training , and experience qualifications for parent coordinators . similarly , in two thousand and twelve , the apa published the guidelines for the practice of parenting coordination , the purpose of which is to  describe best practices for ethical and competent functioning in this unique role  . much of the work of psychologists in the legal system involves treating those within it , including victims and offenders . crime victims . by definition , virtually every crime has a victim . research and clinical experience show that crime victims can experience a range of physical and psychological responses to the event , ranging from transient distress and discomfort to more enduring mental disorders , such as posttraumatic stress disorder . working with victims is a growth area within forensic psychology . indeed , all states in the united states have enacted crime victim legislation , most of which provides for funding of mental health treatment services . despite the stark reality of the large number of crime victims at any point in time , with the exception of work focusing on victims of interpersonal violence , rape and sexual assault , and child abuse , surprisingly little psychological research exists regarding the impact that offending has on victims more generally . that we know so little about the efficacy of interventions designed to assist victims ’ responses to and manage adverse psychological outcomes is particularly surprising given the ubiquitousness of criminal victimization in our society . accordingly , it is important that greater attention be paid to evidencebased approaches that aim to assist victims of crime . offenders . much of the work of forensic psychologists involves assessment and treatment of offenders . an expanding body of empirical literature demonstrates that offender rehabilitation can significantly reduce recidivism . contemporary approaches to offender rehabilitation have been drawn from the psychology of criminal conduct and the risk-needs-responsivity principles that are derived from the model . the pcc , which was developed by andrews and bonta in the nineteen eighties and refined over time , is a theory concerned with individual differences in criminal behavior , making it a particularly useful guide both for assessing the risk of recidivism and for planning rehabilitation attempts . the pcc provides directions for the assessment and treatment of offenders that are embodied in the principles of rnr . the risk principle directs that the degree of intensity of treatment programs for offenders must be matched to an offender level of risk . therefore , more intensive intervention is provided to those assessed as being a high risk for reoffending . conversely , lowerrisk offenders have been shown to derive better outcomes from a less intensive level of service and intervention . the needs principle posits that , to reduce recidivism , treatment must focus on the offender  criminogenic needs  . the responsivity principle considers factors that may affect or even impede an offender response to interventions . two general types of factors affect responsivity . one involves factors internal to the individual including , for example , intellectual functioning , selfesteem , and motivation level . a second type involves external factors such as staff characteristics , therapeutic relationships , environmental support , and program content and delivery . taken together , offender rehabilitation programs that are based on the rnr principles have been found to significantly reduce reoffense rates among offenders . the pcc and the development of the rnr model have formed the basis for many of the gains made in offender rehabilitation . using these principles , rates of reoffending can be reduced by as much as thirty percent across different types of offenders . psychologists researching psychological matters of particular interest to the legal system . in addition to researching the legal system and its functioning , psychologists conduct research on a multitude of psychological factors or phenomena that are of particular interest to the legal system . some of these areas of inquiry are discussed next . some psychological phenomena are of particular interest to the legal system given their nature , and research psychologists have made considerable contributions in these areas . because identification of the accused by eyewitnesses is integral to many convictions , understanding how accurate eyewitnesses are and what factors may affect their recollections is highly important . not surprisingly , a voluminous literature examines this issue , most of which has been produced by experimental and social psychologists . similarly , factors associated with increased suggestiblilty of child witnesses and strategies that can be employed to increase accuracy of their accounts are of great import to the legal system . in response , research psychologists have made great contributions in this area as well . as a final example , psychopathy defined as a  constellation of affective , interpersonal and behavioral characteristics , including egocentricity , impulsivity , irresponsibility , shallow emotions , lack of empathy , guilt , or remorse ; pathological lying ; manipulativeness ; and the persistent violation of social norms and expectations  is of particular interest to the legal system , given the high rates of persistent offending displayed by persons with this disorder . a great deal of research literature has been compiled by clinical and experimental psychologists examining the causes , correlates , manifestations , assessment , and treatment of psychopathy . many legal issues involve matters of psychology . these are typically referred to as psycholegal capacities . understanding the nature of these psycholegal capacities is important to both the legal system and the mental health professionals who may be called on to assess persons when such capacities are at issue . in addition , psychologists researching these matters have devoted considerable efforts to defining the nature of these capacities . when evaluating psycholegal capacities , psychologists employ a variety of tools and techniques , some of which are used in more traditional settings that psychologists work in and some of which have been developed for use in forensic settings . these assessment tasks are either descriptive or predictive . integral to understanding the potential value and accuracy of such evaluations is research that operationalizes these psycholegal capacities and examines the utility of various techniques and instruments that are designed to assess them . only if research findings indicating that psychologists have some special abilities in understanding these issues are psychologists justified as entering the courts as  experts  and the courts justified in hearing psychologists ’ testimony . thus , psychologists conduct research examining the utility of various assessment tools and approaches that have been developed to describe psycholegal constructs or inform predictions of behaviors of interest . another common forensic evaluation task involves prediction . predictive evaluations require the psychologist to comment on the likelihood of some future event . in an attempt to identify the causes of violent behavior , a psychologist might investigate its emotional , behavioral , and cognitive correlates and the efficacy of various treatments and interventions . alternatively , psychologists might conduct research examining the accuracy of a test or tool that has been designed to inform mental health professionals ’ judgments about such risk . in both cases , the psychologist is conducting research relevant to an important issue of concern to courts : competence to stand trial or violence risk assessment and intervention.there is no uniform or consensual definition of forensic psychology , and it is clear that psychologists make contributions to the legal system in a multitude of ways . hugo munsterberg , ¨ the first and perhaps most ardent proponent of what psychology had to offer the legal system , recognized this more than a century ago . in his one thousand, nine hundred and eight treatise , on the witness stand , munsterberg¨ discussed a variety of ways in which psychologists could contribute to legal proceedings , with chapters devoted to phenomena as varied as lie detection , eyewitness memory , false confessions , and crime prevention . munsterberg ’ s¨ early work was widely castigated , and he could not have fathomed the success and growth the field has seen over the past century . in the century that has passed since munsterberg ’ s¨ book , psychologists have become involved with the legal process and provided assistance to the legal system a multitude of ways , providing assistance to the courts in decision making , researching matters of interest to the legal system , and offering services to persons involved with the legal system . as the information in this chapter shows , the roles that forensic psychologists play are broad and varied , with some areas being far more developed than others . the reason that forensic psychology , as a field , is broad and diverse is that it reflects the breadth and diversity of the law . as such , we can expect an expanding array of topics in law with which psychology can contribute on both the micro and macro levels .

       "'Prior to developing a methodological approach to conducting an FMHA, the clinician should possess a thorough understanding of the law applicable to the case. From that law flows the questions that will be addressed by the mental health expert. However, because legal definitions are not tantamount to psychological concepts, an important element in conducting an FMHA entails translating legal language about functional capacities and behavior into relevant measurable constructs. For example, no equivalent solitary constructs exist in the mental health sciences for legal terms such as knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Experts conducting FMHAs must therefore operationalize these legal concepts in a way that permits them to be meaningfully measured. As another example, a forensic practitioner must translate “competence to stand trial” (which is a legal matter or construct) into elements that can be assessed (such as “understand and assist”). Additionally, although it is generally true that “the law does not presume that any psychiatric diagnostic condition is synonymous with any legal incompetency” (Grisso, 1986, p. 8), in some jurisdictions, the law specifies a direct link between a diagnostic condition and a legal outcome (Heilbrun, Grisso, & Goldstein, 2009). This distinction has clear implications for the structure of an FMHA, and it requires forensic mental health professionals to be familiar with the relevant law.'"

       "'the kinds of test patterns commonly found in persons with a stress disorder. To the contrary, the obtained data painted a picture of a psychologically resourceful woman with many personality strengths and above-average capacity to deal with stressful situations without becoming unduly upset by them. The psychologist informed the retaining attorney that the results of the examination were likely to work against his client’s case. Acting in accord with allowable adversarial procedures, the attorney declined to have a report written and did not identify the psychologist as an expert witness in the case, thereby shielding the psychologist’s information from discovery (see Weiner, Chapter 21 this volume). To the psychologist’s surprise, however, the attorney thanked him for these seemingly unhelpful results. He had suspected some exaggeration on his client’s part and now had some dependable basis for attempting to persuade her to drop or at least reduce her claims, which would make it less difficult for him to represent her.  Concerning the potential for multiple relationships, attorneys may at times ask or expect practitioners to include therapeutic services in their work with a client they have referred for a forensic evaluation. At other times, an attorney may ask a client’s therapist if he or she would be willing to write an evaluation of the person for use in a forensic matter. The Ethics Code and the Specialty Guidelines urge practitioners to avoid such dual roles, out of concern that providing forensic and therapeutic services to the same or closely related individuals might impair their objectivity and risk doing harm to the recipient of their services. If asked to undertake concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services, “Forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider” (APA, 2002, 3.05; APA 2013, Standard 4.02). Should practitioners be required by law, institutional policy, or external circumstances to serve in more than one role in a judicial or administrative proceeding, the guidelines recommend explaining the potential drawbacks of such multiple relationships and striving to minimize any negative consequences of the particular circumstance.'"

       "'professions derive considerable benefit from having a set of principles , standards , and guidelines that constitute their code of ethics . a code of ethics serves important purposes for professionals and the public they serve . for practitioners , an ethics code provides a moral compass to guide their conduct and help shape their decisions in uncertain situations . it lends prestige to their profession , fosters pride in their allegiance to values and skills shared with their colleagues , and enhances their sense of professional identity . for the public , the existence of an ethics code fosters their trust in a profession , informs them about what they can expect from practitioners in the profession , and safeguards their welfare by deterring unethical professional conduct . in this last regard , unethical conduct , whether intended or not , can result in serious consequences for professional practitioners . even without violating criminal law , which could lead to being fined or jailed by court order , misbehavior that comes to the attention of an ethics committee or state board of psychology can provoke letters of reprimand , dismissal from membership in professional societies , and suspension or revocation of a license to practice . having been penalized in these ways can prevent practitioners from securing liability insurance , being listed in directories and on insurance reimbursement panels , and , most critically for forensic psychologists , having credibility as an expert witness whose integrity will not be impugned in the courtroom . along with being potential sources of penalties when violated , ethics codes and the committees and boards that enforce them can provide support when practicing psychologists confront problematic expectations or unreasonable demands . in an illustrative case , a patient whose therapist assigned her some reading complained to an ethics committee that he was abandoning her and failing to provide adequate care . acting on the psychologist behalf , the committee that heard the patient complaint informed her that bibliotherapy was a legitimate and acceptable way for her therapist to augment her sessions in an effort to be helpful , and the complaint was not pursued further . unreasonable or intrusive demands may on occasion come from supervisors , employers , or organizations . as an example in a correctional setting , a prison psychologist was instructed to serve on disciplinary committees that were hearing his patients ’ cases and deciding their punishments . by referring to his ethical obligation to avoid problematic multiple relationships and conflicts of interest , as elaborated in this chapter , the psychologist was able to clarify the impropriety of his serving on these committees and was excused from doing so . a recurring and sometimes problematic demand in forensic practice involves psychological testing protocols that are subpoenaed and deemed discoverable by the court . in these instances , psychologists can refer to their ethical obligation to  make reasonable efforts to maintain the security of test materials  as well as to copyright laws safeguarding published tests , to appeal to the court that the released information should have restricted circulation and consist of test data but not test forms . to practice principled forensic psychology , psychologists must recognize both the constraining and the supportive features of ethics codes and related guidelines and conduct themselves in a professionally proper manner at all times . the main document providing psychologists direction for ethical conduct is the just mentioned  ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct  promulgated by the apa . this document , commonly referred to as the ethics code , pertains broadly to psychological practice , teaching , and research but also has numerous implications for forensic practice . the ethics code comprises five general principles and ten specific standards . the general principles are considered  aspirational in nature  and are  intended to guide and inspire psychologists toward the very highest ethical ideals of the profession  . the specific standards translate these aspirations into mandatory and enforceable rules of conduct that psychologists are obliged to follow . two other documents providing guidance in practicing principled forensic psychology are the  specialty guidelines for forensic psychology  and the  guidelines for child custody evaluations in family law proceedings ,  both of which are modeled after the ethics code and are endorsed by the apa . of particular relevance for psychologists involved in family law cases are two additional documents promulgated by the apa :  guidelines for the practice of parenting coordination  and  guidelines for psychological evaluation in child protection matters.  like the general principles in the ethics code , the forensic specialty , child custody , parenting coordination , and child protection guidelines are not mandatory rules of conduct and were not intended to constitute a basis for disciplinary action or legal liability . instead , these guidelines are aspirational in nature and recommend various procedures for maintaining highquality forensic services . forensic practitioners should be as familiar with these recommended procedures as they are with the obligatory rules of conduct in the ethics code.this chapter reviews the five general principles and ten specific standards in the apa ethics code , with attention to their implications for forensic practice and how they may be elaborated in the forensic specialty and child custody guidelines . the chapter then considers some aspects of personal values and professional responsibility that forensic psychologists need to keep in mind , and it concludes with a summary of recommendations for minimizing vulnerability to ethical complaints and legal actions in forensic practice . the section on general principles in the apa ethics code delineates five aspirational goals toward which psychologists should strive in their practice , teaching , and research . beneficence and malfeasance . psychologists should safeguard the rights and welfare of those to whom they provide services and maintain vigilance to ensure that their influence is not misused . they should strive to benefit those with whom they work and avoid doing harm , and they should recognize any adverse effect of their own physical and mental health on the services they provide . fidelity and responsibility . psychologists should establish trusting relationships with their clients , clarify their professional roles and obligations , and coordinate services with other professionals to each client benefit . they should in addition attend to the ethical probity of colleagues and provide some measure of pro bono service . integrity . psychologists should promote truthfulness in research , teaching , and practice and avoid dishonesty , deception , subterfuge , and misrepresentation of fact . should they deem any deception justifiable , they should consider carefully whether it is necessary , whether the benefits of the deception outweigh any adverse consequences it might have , and what steps should be taken to minimize or repair any resulting harmful effects of the deception . justice . psychologists should allow equal access to their services by all people , whether advantaged or disadvantaged and whatever their background , and they should provide services of equal quality to all . psychologists should take reasonable care to prevent any biases or limitations of their competence from leading to improper or inadequate practices on their part . respect for people rights and dignity . psychologists should respect the dignity and worth of all people and their rights to privacy and autonomy . this respect should extend to persons with diverse backgrounds , including diversity related to age , gender , gender identity , race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sexual orientation , disability , and socioeconomic status . psychologists should neither condone nor participate in discriminatory practices based on such individual differences . when applied in individual cases , these principles overlap in many respects , and a case illustrating any one of these principles usually illustrates one or more other principles as well . similar overlap characterizes the ten standards in the ethics code discussed next . for extended discussion of how these principles and standards interrelate and how they should be applied in various contexts , readers are referred to contemporary texts by bersoff , kitchener and anderson , knapp and vandecreek , and koocher and keithspiegel . as previously stated , the apa ethics code comprises ten specific standards intended to serve as enforceable rules of conduct that psychologists are obliged to follow . unlike the general principles to which psychologists should aspire , these standards constitute requirements they are expected to meet in order to remain in compliance with the ethics code . the standards deal broadly with considerations in practice , teaching , and research , and they vary in their specific implications for practicing principled forensic psychology . however , forensic psychologists are psychologists first and forensic specialists second , and they are accordingly responsible for ensuring that all of their professional actions are consistent with the ethics code . the first standard in the ethics code provides instructions for resolving conflicts between ethical considerations and the expectations or demands of legal , governmental , or organizational entities . a key provision in the two thousand and two ethics code concerning such expectations and demands was amended in two thousand and ten. this provision had specified that , when faced with ethical conflicts that could not be resolved ,  psychologists may adhere to the requirements of the law.  many psychologists viewed this provision as appearing to endorse the socalled nuremberg plea that commission of evil acts was acceptable  because i was following orders.  to protect psychologists from feeling obliged to comply with demands to engage in inhumane conduct and to prevent psychologists from appealing to  orders from above  to justify such conduct , this provision was replaced with  under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.  other parts of the standard on ethical issues address procedures to follow should psychologists suspect ethical violations by another psychologist . ordinarily in such instances , an informal contact with the suspected violator should precede filing any formal complaint , and filing such complaints should be considered when informal resolution seems inappropriate or would violate confidentiality rights or after collegial discussion has failed to resolve the matter of concern . even with such clear directives to follow , however , ethical issues arising in forensic psychology practice may evoke respectable differences of opinion that call for some exercise of judgment , as in the next case . case one. a psychologist was asked by the attorney representing a father in a child custody dispute to review a report summarizing an evaluation of him that was prepared by a psychologist retained by the mother attorney . the reviewing psychologist was initially impressed with the quality of the examining psychologist report , which included sufficient language to justify casting numerous aspersions on the quality of this father character . on closer inspection , however , the reviewer became concerned by how much of the examiner language appeared to be taken directly from a computergenerated test report . the reviewer was aware that narrative statements in computerized test reports warrant forming hypotheses but not drawing definite conclusions , because they describe characteristics of people in general who have certain scores on a test and do not necessarily describe the person who was examined . upon printing his own computerbased narrative from the examining psychologist test data , the reviewer confirmed that this examiner had indeed cribbed long sections of his report from the computer narrative without acknowledging their source . moreover , he discovered that a not in the computer narrative had been omitted from the examining psychologist written report at a critical point in the text where it would have reversed negative conclusions in the report about the father suitability as a parent . the reviewing psychologist testified to this effect in court , with the computergenerated report and the examining psychologist written report in evidence . the court concluded that the examining psychologist had misrepresented his findings and altered his report to please the attorney who had retained him . news of this outcome subsequently circulated among the local community of attorneys and psychologists working in family law cases . although the ethical transgression was clear in the preceding case , the sequence of events raises some procedural questions . to begin with , an informal collegial discussion of the matters of concern , prescribed in the ethics code as the first step in dealing with a suspected or potential ethical violation , was not an option in this instance , because the violation had already been written into a signed and discoverable document . nevertheless , before reporting his discovery to the attorney who had retained him and appearing on the witness stand , should the reviewing psychologist have informed the examining psychologist about finding the missing not in his report ? this consultation would have given the examining psychologist an opportunity , prior to being confronted in the courtroom , to apologize for an unintended oversight or to prepare some defense of his actions . as another possibility , should the reviewing psychologist , instead of or in addition to giving testimony , have brought the matter to the attention of the state board of psychology or the ethics committees of any professional organizations of which the examining psychologist was a member ? did the damage to the examining psychologist future credibility as an expert witness constitute a sufficient penalty for his misrepresentation , or should the involved parties have pressed for further sanctions , such as prosecution for perjury or actions against his license ? such matters of judgment commonly arise in forensic cases , despite the guidance of unambiguous principles , and equally principled psychologists might for various reasons answer the preceding questions in different ways . the standard on competence addresses psychologists ’ obligations to provide services only within the boundaries of their abilities as gleaned from their education , training , study , relevant supervision , and professional experience . they can serve populations or employ methods unfamiliar to them only after sufficient preparation , consultation , and/or supervision to ensure professional competence . only in emergency situations , when other qualified help is not available , should they act beyond the boundaries of their competence . psychologists are further instructed by the competence standard to maintain their competence , which speaks to the importance of continuing education ; to base their work on established scientific and professional knowledge in their discipline ; and to prevent personal problems and conflicts from interfering with adequate performance of their workrelated duties . in addition to the numerous implications of these requirements for forensic practice , the competence standard specifies that psychologists serving in forensic roles should be reasonably familiar with judicial and administrative rules governing these roles . no psychologist can be adequately educated for every exigency , however , and determining whether competent service is being provided may at times involve some degree of judgment . the next case illustrates effective preparation for a forensic consultation and appropriate candor about professional competencies . case two. a psychologist was asked to analyze some insurance policies for their readability levels . he was experienced in assessing intellectual functioning , but his familiarity with readability analysis and insurance policies was limited . he related his background and skills to the lawyer who wanted to retain him and clarified the nature of the services he was being asked to provide . he then consulted with two colleagues who regularly assessed readability level and reviewed some publications recommended by them . he was then able to describe to the lawyer the procedures he would follow in the analysis and to indicate that he had expert consultation available to assist him as needed . on this basis , having initially been candid about his capabilities and then taken steps to become adequately prepared for his task , he was able to provide a helpful analysis of the readability level in the insurance policies . the competence standard also bears directly on forensic psychology in requiring practitioners to establish firm ties between their practices and the scientific bases for these practices . chapter twenty two in this volume by otto , kay , and hess emphasizes basing courtrelated activities including consultations , administrative hearings , and depositions as well as appearances on the witness stand on as firm an empirical basis as possible . tensions nevertheless arise between what forensic psychologists know for sure and about what they are asked to opine , and discrete decisions must often be made in the absence of absolute certainty . when told only that there is a seventy percent chance of rain , we must make a yes-or-no decision whether to take an umbrella , and forensic psychologists are regularly asked for similarly discrete opinions in the absence of one hundred percent conclusive evidence one way or the other . ordinarily the most principled course of action in such instances is offering a reasonable estimate , as in reporting a slight , moderate , or considerable chance of reoffending by a person being considered for probation or parole and letting the court or administrative body address the dichotomous decision that is properly its to make . in this vein , monahan and steadman advised mental health law specialists to model the way meteorologists announce a seventy percent change of rain , as by responding to a question about violence risk with a percentage estimate of its likelihood in a particular case . because competence is a critical consideration for forensic psychologists and one that often undergirds an ethics complaint or a lawsuit , the forensic specialty , child custody , parenting coordination , and child protection guidelines all pay considerable attention to it . in addition to paralleling many of the ethics code specifications concerning competence , the forensic specialty guidelines stress acquiring and maintaining not only knowledge but relevant skills as well and becoming knowledgeable not only about the legal system but also about the legal rights of individuals . these guidelines further admonish forensic psychologists to : give full and accurate accounts of both their skills and their knowledge when presenting themselves to clients . base their opinions and testimony as much as possible on scientific foundations . clarify the limits of their conclusions and recommendations as well as the factual basis for them . keep abreast of developments in the law as well as in psychology . ensure that their own values do not compromise the services they are rendering . the child custody , parenting coordination , and child protection guidelines supplement the ethics code by defining competence in these areas of endeavor to include having a thorough understanding of child and family development and psychopathology , being familiar with what is known about the impact of divorce on children , and keeping current with the child custody literature . as attested by this specification in the child custody guidelines , the competence of forensic psychologists is unlikely to be uniform across criminal , civil , and family law proceedings . a forensic practitioner who is expert in conducting competency and insanity evaluations in criminal cases may not be familiar with the literature , techniques , and considerations relevant to a fitness-for-duty evaluation , such as confidentiality issues specific to the workplace and prediction questions central to personnel evaluations . likewise , a psychologist with expertise in criminal cases may not know enough about the technicalities of probate and estate management to provide useful psychological consultation in a civil case involving alleged malfeasance by an estate administrator or executor . as a stark example of expert testimony that was incompetent by virtue of inadequate foundation , golding described the testimony of dr. james grigson , a psychiatrist , whose work formed the basis for the u.s. supreme court analysis in barefoot v. estelle . without having evaluated barefoot , grigson claimed that he could  predict future dangerousness of an individual within reasonable medical certainty ,  that barefoot was in the  most severe category of sociopaths ,  and that he was  one hundred percent and absolutely barefoot would commit future acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society  . crossexamination has been the mechanism traditionally used by the courts to challenge or dismiss such outlandish claims . however , crossexamination is often inadequate in this regard , because it relies on attorneys , judges , and jurors to make determinations concerning technical matters that are known only by other experts in the area . as a partial solution to this problem , golding suggested placing an affirmative duty on potential experts to clarify the basis of their testimony , to show the evidence of the specific bases of their conclusions , and to describe the limits of their testimony , all of which would be consistent with the ethics code and forensic specialty guidelines . unfortunately , this suggestion would still leave it in the hands of attorneys to conduct telling crossexaminations on technicalities of psychology , which they may not be equipped to do . as another potential solution to instances of incompetent expert testimony , shuman and greenberg commented that many such problems could be resolved from the bench if judges would take professional ethics codes more seriously than they apparently do . in barefoot , for example , grigson testimony passed judicial review but not psychiatric peer review . an american psychiatric association amicus brief asserted that grigson should not have been permitted to testify in barefoot v. estelle because it is  unethical for a psychologist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination  . shuman and greenberg also decry instances in which courts accept expert testimony in custody cases from a psychologist who has examined only one parent and offers an opinion about which of two parents would better serve the needs of the child . aside from being patently unsound how can a comparative opinion be formed when only one parent has been seen ? this type of practice , like testifying about the psychological characteristics of a person who has not been examined , violates the ethics code except in special circumstances , such as providing a record review concerning someone who is not available to be examined ; see also apa , two thousand and twelvea , nine ) . as a further example of questionable procedure , consider the courtroom performance of the two psychologists testifying in the next case . case three. in a murder trial involving an insanity defense , a psychologist retained by the defense attorney testified that impairments associated with borderline personality disorder had caused the defendant lifelong adjustment problems , including mood fluctuations , excessive anger , and poor emotional control . this disorder , the defense psychologist said , had prevented the defendant from conforming his conduct to the law and distinguishing right from wrong when he stabbed to death a seventy fouryearold woman and her fouryearold granddaughter . the psychologist offered this testimony despite the existence of a letter found in the purse of the defendant exwife outlining the steps she was to take in helping him construct a convincing insanity defense . could the defendant have been legally insane at the time of the stabbings but subsequently been able to become involved in the planning of his defense ? this interesting question became moot , however , because the judge ruled the letter inadmissible due to the marital privilege even though the couple had divorced a year before the murders . the psychologist retained by the prosecutor testified that the defendant knew the nature and quality of the charges against him and was able to distinguish right from wrong because voices he claimed to hear were coming from inside and not outside his head . some questions about the competence of the two expert witnesses in this case come quickly to mind . were they familiar with the applicable legal criteria for insanity ? did these criteria , like the laws in most states , disallow personality disorders from consideration as a valid insanity defense ? did these psychologists employ adequate methods to assist them in reaching their conclusions ? did the defendant claim of hearing voices raise some doubt about the accuracy of a borderline personality disorder diagnosis ? did one or both of the psychologists have an adequate foundation for their testimony , and did they articulate their findings in a manner consistent with the standard set forth in the ethics code ? the probable answers to these questions bring into sharp relief the kind of inept courtroom display that can foster public cynicism and mistrust of mental health experts . such incompetence is by definition unethical , and it is unethical conduct in the courtroom , not proper forensic practice , that provides critics of forensic mental health practice with grist for their mill . finally , with respect to competent practice , forensic psychologists should recognize and express clearly the certainty of their opinions and conclusions . in the insanity case just discussed , the two experts could have drawn on definite and wellestablished criteria to guide their evaluation of the defendant , these being the two  prongs  of insanity as defined in statutory law . the first of these prongs , which is universally applicable in u.s. jurisdictions , invokes a cognitive incapacity that prevented the accused from recognizing the criminality of his or her actions at the time of the alleged offense or that prevented the defendant from appreciating the legal or moral wrongfulness of this conduct . the second prong , which is an alternative statutory criterion for insanity in some but not all jurisdictions , is volitional in nature and speaks to a loss of behavioral control such that the accused was unable to alter or refrain from his or her criminal conduct at the time . in other situations , forensic psychologists may have to form their opinions with less certain criteria to draw on than are available when insanity is the issue . in jury selection , for example , a consulting psychologist who can assess a potential juror opinions regarding the issue at trial may have little way of knowing how this person might be influenced by the leadership style of the jury foreperson and the group dynamics among the jurors when they assemble in the jury room . in practice , this circumstance means that forensic consultants are likely to be more helpful in juror selection than they can be in jury selection . because of the uncertainty inherent in many of the conclusions they form , forensic psychologists are well advised to work with a graded system of levels of confidence in their conclusions . these levels of certainty should cover a broad range of possibilities that can be expressed in such terms as  reasonably certain ,   strongly suggestive ,   some indications but not compelling ,  and  the available data do not warrant an expert opinion on this matter.  the level of certainty chosen should be based on the state of knowledge in the areas , the degree to which the particular case touches on definite provisions in the law , and the amount and clarity of available information pertaining to the legal considerations in the case . in the instance of an insanity defense , for example , the law provides clear criteria that can readily be translated into wellresearched psychological characteristics for which clinical research and assessment methods are abundant . in custody cases , by contrast , statutory law provides little in the way of specified criteria for being a suitable parent . forensic psychologists are further well advised to discuss with attorneys who retain them not only the certainty of the knowledge base relevant to their case but also the certainty of the findings they obtain in the particular case and can testify to . even the most sensitive measurement methods may not reveal relevant information in a particular instance , and psychologists should say as much in such cases . competent forensic practitioners take responsibility for describing the weight of the evidence on which their testimony is based , and , even in the absence of a compelling level of certainty , the court may ask for expert guidance , as in the next statement from the bench . it is , of course , not easy to predict future behavior . the fact that such a determination is difficult , however , does not mean that it can not be made . indeed , prediction of future criminal conduct is an essential element in many of the decisions rendered throughout our criminal justice system . . . . what is essential is that the jury have before it all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine . the ethics code standard on human relations speaks to practicing , teaching , and researching psychology in ways that are considerate of others and avoid causing them harm to the degree possible . included in the several sections of the standard are proscriptions against discriminating against , harassing , or exploiting others and guidelines for not becoming involved in multiple relationships and conflicts of interest . forensic activities often put psychologists in situations fraught with risk for being drawn into multiple relationships and conflicts of interest , and the forensic specialty guidelines spell out numerous precautions that practitioners should take in this regard . the guidelines have in turn been supplemented by substantial attention in the literature to the boundaries of and exceptions to multiple relationships . as an important aspect of protecting the wellbeing of persons they evaluate in forensic cases , psychologists should take care to prevent their findings from becoming available to persons who should not receive and do not need to have this information . the next case illustrates one examiner consideration in minimizing harm that might have resulted from his providing necessary information in open court . case four. a psychologist conducting a defendant competence to stand trial evaluation found reasonably clear evidence that the defendant was intellectually disabled . he informed the defendant that he would be saying some things about him in court that might be upsetting to him and make him look bad in the eyes of friends and relatives who were present but that he should not take these comments as a personal criticism . he then told the defendant what the result of intellectual testing indicated , but he added that there were many different ways of defining and measuring intelligence and that these test results did not say anything about whether he was a good or bad person . this sensitivity on the psychologist part fostered mutual respect between him and the defendant and gave the defendant a frame of reference that eased the distress of hearing his limited tested intelligence reported in the courtroom . standard four concerns the responsibility of psychologists to respect and protect the privacy of the people to whom or for whom they provide professional services . the forensic specialty guidelines clarify that this requirement pertains both to clients being evaluated and to retaining parties who request a forensic psychological consultation . because of the extent to which forensic psychologists are charged with unearthing and reporting sensitive findings , issues of privacy and confidentiality can become particularly complex and challenging in their practice . the key questions for forensic psychologists in this regard concern the kinds of information they should release , in what form this information should be released , to whom the information should be released , and the circumstances under which information should be released . the answers to these questions vary , as prescribed by the applicable regulations in a state . the overarching consideration established by the ethics code is that psychologists should release information only to an individual or entity identified in a written consent form signed by the person evaluated , except when the law requires or permits proceeding otherwise . in the absence of such a signed release or legal requirement or permission , any disclosure of information is a violation of privacy rights . issues concerning the preservation of privacy have been complicated in contemporary times by technological advances in modes of information exchange . in a recent survey , mcminn , bearse , heyne , smithberger , and erb found considerable uncertainty among several hundred psychologists regarding the ethicality of using certain communication technologies in professional practice . over onethird of their respondents reported being uncertain about whether it is ethical to use email to provide professional services , contact clients about payment or insurance issues , and send confidential information to other healthcare professionals , and more than onethird were uncertain about the ethicality of using instant messaging to provide consultation and supervision , either by computer or cell phone . these survey findings speak to the point made throughout this chapter that ethical right and wrong sometimes hinges on relative rather than absolute judgments , and indefinite circumstances can allow for respectable differences of opinion concerning proper conduct . the following case , however , illustrates a confidentiality requirement that is unequivocal with respect to what must be done the presence of a nondisclosure agreement . case five. an attorney asked the psychologist to assess the extent of psychological damage in a thirty twoyearold woman who had been sexually assaulted by an appliance repairman . records indicated that the employer had previously received complaints about the repairman conduct when he was doing clerical work in their central office . as their  solution  to his being intolerably obnoxious in the central office , the company assigned him to go to people homes by himself , without supervision , and service their malfunctioning appliances . the consulting psychologist found evidence of substantial psychological dysfunction in the plaintiff , probably attributable to the sexual assault , and also some additional psychic harm apparently resulting from harsh depositions conducted by the company attorneys . the woman attorney reviewed these findings with the company ethics officer , following which the psychologist was paid for his efforts but received no further information about the outcome of the case . he inferred from this sequence of events that the company , faced with the compelling evidence of damage and its proximate causes , had made an out-of-court settlement with the victim and that the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement . the point of this case example with respect to disclosure and privacy is that , with a nondisclosure agreement in place , any use of the case that contained identifying information could void the settlement and make the psychologist vulnerable to legal action by the plaintiff , her attorney , and the company . in such circumstances , everyone working with the psychologist on a case , including secretaries and technicians with access to information about it , is similarly bound by the privilege rights of the attorney client and civilly liable for any breach of privacy . standard five in the ethics code indicates that psychologists are free to make public statements about their professional qualifications and to express their professional opinions on matters related to psychology . in so doing , however , they must avoid making any false or deceptive statements . although they can advertise their credentials and availability as service providers , they must not hire media personnel to provide publicity for them , nor should they solicit public testimonials about their skills from former therapy patients . when they do advertise , forensic psychologists are likely to benefit most from presenting themselves in media to which attorneys attend , given that attorneys are commonly their major referral source . similarly , most forensic practitioners will find it to their advantage to present a continuing education workshop for attorneys . local and state bar associations usually welcome such offerings by psychologists , although psychologists need to be modest in what they promise to provide and not guarantee any beneficial outcomes of participating in their workshop . the forensic specialty guidelines do not speak to advertising , but they do include a section that elaborates several forensically relevant considerations in making professional and public statements . among these are being accurate and avoiding deception in the presentation of opinions ; providing appropriate disclosure of sources of information and the bases of these opinions ; and being careful to differentiate among observations , inferences , and conclusions . the specialty guidelines also caution forensic practitioners to be fair , impartial , and respectful should they have occasion to comment on or criticize the conduct of other professionals or participants in a legal proceeding . similar restraint should characterize any out-of-court statements by forensic psychologists about legal proceedings in which they are involved . these particular specialty guidelines overlap somewhat with the ethics code requirements concerning privacy , confidentiality , and privilege , and they also relate closely to the chapters in this volume on writing forensic reports and serving as an expert witness . the text of standard six in the ethics code obliges psychologists to facilitate the services they provide by documenting their work with adequate case records and making these records available to other professionals , as appropriate and within the constraints of confidentiality . the ethics code does not specify the length of time that case records should be kept , but psychologists should be aware of applicable regulations in this regard in the states in which they practice . in florida , for example , statutory law requires licensed psychologists to retain complete psychological records for each service user for a minimum of three years and either the complete records or a summary of them for an additional four years . the apa provides some additional nonmandatory guidelines to assist practitioners in managing their records in the individual case , and the specialty guidelines provide further specific direction in this regard . with respect to fees , this section of the ethics code includes several restrictive provisions with which forensic practitioners must be sure to comply . psychologists must not withhold records for nonpayment of services when these records are needed for emergency treatment of an individual who has been evaluated ; they must refrain from bartering agreements in which goods or services are accepted as payment for fees , unless such nonmonetary remuneration is not clinically contraindicated and is not in any way exploitative ; and they must not kick back to referral sources any portion of fees to which they are entitled on the basis of services they have provided . the forensic specialty guidelines add to these restrictions a caution against contingency fees , which is an especially important consideration in personal injury litigations that could involve substantial settlements . forensic psychologists should charge for their services on an hourly basis at a prearranged rate or at a prearranged amount for providing particular services . they should never charge on a contingency basis that depends on the outcome of a case . charging on a contingency basis in a personal injury litigation when retained by the plaintiff attorney can mean that the larger the settlement , the more the psychologist gets paid . it can also mean not getting paid at all , should the defendant prevail in the case . operating in such contingency circumstances makes the psychologist an interested party with a clear conflict of interest who can not be expected to provide objective and unbiased testimony . the standard on education and training holds psychologists responsible for designing appropriate experiences and providing appropriate knowledge to accomplish the goals of any program in which they participate . these goals and the nature of the program should be described clearly and accurately to all interested parties . teachers and supervisors must provide accurate information to their students and their supervisees , and they are additionally obliged to evaluate the performance of these students and supervisees and give them timely feedback . these and other sections of the standard address general concerns in psychology and have no direct bearing on or implications for forensic practice . nevertheless , psychology students can become involved in court proceedings , and their involvement can at times become an ethical minefield , with life-and-death consequences , as in the next case . case six. a university professor offered his clinical psychology graduate students to the district attorney office to evaluate defendants , which gave the students valuable but unpaid experience and saved the prosecutor office thousands of dollars . in a case in which a mother was accused of killing her fouryearold daughter , tests administered by one of these students were reported by the media as likely to help seal a firstdegree murder conviction . when deposed , however , the student testified that she had been unsupervised and that the multiphasic personality inventory , second edition she had administered was the first with which she had any experience . she also testified that she had been told by her professor to change some of the answers on the twompi2 based on the fact that the test had been administered in prison . the prosecutor office claimed ignorance of students having been sent alone to conduct evaluations on firstdegree murder cases . nevertheless , as a result of this incident , eight other firstdegree murder cases came under review , with one defense attorney claiming that the psychological testing had been critical in her client accepting a guilty plea instead of proceeding with a jury trial , and the prosecutor office discontinued its use of student examiners . as for the professor , he said subsequently that it was all a misunderstanding and that the student had become flustered during her deposition and made some misleading statements . however , he did not dispute the production of an altered twompi2 answer sheet . the ethical misconduct in this case requires no further comment . with regard to research , standard eight in the ethics code delineates requirements for obtaining informed consent from research participants , protecting participants from any adverse consequences of participating in a study , and sparing members of a targeted research population from disciplinary or punitive action should they decline to participate . also included in this section are considerations in determining appropriate inducements for research participants , whether and what types of deception are permissible , and the kinds of feedback that participants should be provided . with regard to publishing , the standard calls for giving appropriate credit for authorship , and it specifically proscribes plagiarism and the fabrication of data . this standard is fully applicable to the scholarly work of forensic psychologists , whose research efforts may also present some specialtyspecific ethical issues , particularly if they are collecting data within prison walls . for example , can informed consent be given by incarcerated research participants who as prisoners may not be operating under their own free will ? might some of the requested research information compromise the rights of participants by being tantamount to their testifying against themselves ? alternatively , if researchers do acquire incriminating information from a participant , whether by intent or inadvertently , can they withhold this information from the authorities without risk of becoming an accessory ? does the researcher feel sufficiently comfortable and have the necessary familiarity with a particular prison facilities and procedures to function effectively in that setting ? likewise , have all of the participants in the research project whose assigned tasks will bring them into the prison been adequately prepared for being behind bars in the company of accused or convicted criminals ? these questions call for careful consideration of the circumstances in each instance , and there is no absolute or automatic answer that will inevitably be correct in every instance . in professional presentations as well as publications , psychologists are obliged to take reasonable steps to avoid factual errors and misleading or unwarranted statements . the following case illustrates one psychologist public failure to do the homework for which he was ethically responsible . case seven. a prominent forensic psychologist was presenting a paper at the annual apa convention on ethical considerations in serving as an expert witness . he emphasized the importance of practicing at the highest standards of empiricism , and he illustrated shortcomings in this regard by referring to a testing procedure developed by a wellknown psychologist . he assailed the procedure lack of reliability and validity and called its use improper . a few minutes into this harangue , a man in the audience rose and introduced himself as the psychologist being vilified . he then listed studies in several prominent journals that documented the psychometric soundness of his procedure and asked the presenter if he had read these studies . the presenter , sweating profusely , mumbled something inaudible and sat down without finishing his talk . the lesson in this case is that public presenters should speak as if anyone about whom they will be speaking , especially if in critical fashion , were in the room . comments that could not in good conscience be voiced in the presence of a professional colleague whose work is being criticized should not be voiced at all . unlike the presenter in this case , moreover , a principled forensic psychologist would not impugn another psychologist work without having conducted a thorough search of the literature concerning it . the assessment standard in the ethics code has substantial implications for the practice of forensic psychology , because assessment constitutes a considerable part of what forensic psychologists do . questions of competence , criminal responsibility , and diminished capacity in criminal cases are basically assessment questions , as are questions of competence and personal injury in civil cases , questions of child custody and parental suitability in family law cases , and questions about violence risk . the first three sections of the assessment standard define the essence of ethical assessment practice . first , psychologists should offer opinions only about persons they have examined , except when the person is not available for examination or when only a consultation or record review is necessary . second , assessments should be conducted with reliable and valid methods that are appropriate for the purpose of the examination . third , informed consent must be obtained from the person to be examined , unless the examination is mandated by law or is a routine part of an activity in which the person is a voluntary participant , such as preemployment screening . six other sections of this standard delineate considerations related to test construction , interpreting and explaining test results , releasing test data , maintaining the security of test materials , and using test scoring and interpretation services . two further sections of the standard caution psychologists against using obsolete tests and outdated test results and against promoting the use of psychological assessment techniques by unqualified persons . the forensic specialty guidelines echo the ethics code with regard to conducting assessments , and they elaborate four additional considerations that should guide forensic practice . these considerations include : focusing assessments on the legally relevant factors in each individual case . recognizing individual differences that could result in the same test finding having different implications for people from different ethnic or sociocultural backgrounds . providing the appropriate kind and amount of feedback to examinees in legal proceedings . retaining adequate documentation of assessment findings and making this documentation available as permitted or required by law . it may well be that ethical problems for the practitioner arise more frequently in conducting assessments than in any other forensic activity . a relatively recently emerging ethical problem that merits special mention concerns coaching . most practitioners would consider it appropriate to accept an attorney request to help coach a person in giving testimony , as in instructing a defendant to sit up straight and establish eye contact with the judge , prosecutor , and jurors . to the extent that slouching and looking down at the floor might send cues that the defendant was guilty or being untruthful , irrespective of the evidence , a psychologist coaching avoidance of these behaviors might well be serving the purposes of justice . however , what if an attorney representing a client in a personal injury or a disability determination case asks the psychologist to coach this client on how to appear impaired on measures of neuropsychological functioning ? most psychologists would deem this type of coaching unethical , and coaching a person in how to answer certain kinds of questions and perform certain kinds of tasks has in fact been demonstrated to produce misleading results in neuropsychological and competency examinations . the therapy standard deals mainly with restrictions on sexual intimacies between psychologists and their current or former psychotherapy patients and these patients ’ significant others . other sections of the standard concern such matters as the necessity of informed consent by persons being provided psychotherapy , considerations in offering or providing therapy for persons already receiving mental health services elsewhere , and issues related to the interruption or termination of an ongoing treatment relationship . for forensic psychologists providing psychotherapy to litigants , there is an inherent conflict between their obligation to protect a patient privilege and the customary expectation that they will be disclosing pertinent information to officers of the court and other appropriately designated individuals . whereas forensic practitioners conducting assessments rarely have difficulty identifying the person or entity requesting the evaluation as their client , and not the person being evaluated , deciding who the client is may not come so easily when they are functioning as psychotherapists , particularly when they are working in correctional settings or with parents involved in a custody dispute . with respect to working in a correctional setting , consider the dilemma of the psychologist in the following case . case eight. the psychologist was employed by the department of corrections with duties that included providing psychotherapy as part of a prisonbased drug rehabilitation program for addicted inmates . during a psychotherapy session , an inmate mentioned in passing that he had  fifty ccs of liquid cocaine stashed on the ward.  the psychologist was aware that he was now faced with having to choose between maintaining prison security and preserving patient confidentiality . he could report what the inmate had told him , thereby sacrificing his trustworthiness as someone in whom the inmate could confide , or he could keep the inmate secret , thereby endangering the drugfree status of the inmate and his wardmates and colluding with him in a violation of prison rules . as in this case , ethical dilemmas rarely have a simple and entirely comfortable solution . possible harm could be done by making either of the choices listed , but perhaps more harm would ensue to more people from allowing the cocaine to remain on the ward than from losing the inmate trust in his therapist , however much the psychologist would regret having to make this choice . ofttimes the best solution to a dilemma is avoiding it in the first place , whenever possible . there would have been a regrettable choice but not a difficult one in case eight if the psychologist had initially presented a clear statement of the roles and obligations of both parties to the treatment . beginning psychotherapy with an explicit treatment contract is standard recommended procedure , but it can be overlooked when the therapy has been mandated , as in this instance . if the psychologist in this case had stated during the first treatment session that he would be obliged to report any violation of prison rules , there would have been no dilemma . although he might have regretted having to sacrifice a confiding treatment relationship , his honesty and dependability in reporting the violation , just as he had said he would , might have sustained rather than undermined the inmate trust in him . the next case illustrates effective implementation in a correctional setting of a pretreatment agreement intended to provide protection for the inmates as well as the institution . case nine. a prison psychologist was assigned by the department of corrections to conduct sex offender group psychotherapy , the purpose of which was to facilitate the offenders ’ successful adjustment upon returning to the community . a potential ethical dilemma lurking in this assignment concerned the group members ’ privacy rights beyond reporting their progress toward being considered for parole . the psychologist clarified to the group members at the outset that their general progress and risk of reoffending , which would include their compliance with prison rules , would be reported to the prison authorities , but other specific information they discussed in the group would be kept confidential . concurrently , the psychologist made it clear to the authorities that content of the group sessions unrelated to general progress and risk of reoffending would not be forwarded and that privileged communication would remain in effect except for the general progress report . psychologists providing treatment for parents involved in custody disputes are also likely to face choices between reporting or withholding certain information , and they may at times have difficulty reconciling the specific ethical standard concerning privacy with the general principle of avoiding doing harm . some potentially difficult decisions are taken out of the psychologist hands by the law , as in the case of the requirement in all fifty states for professionals to report suspected child abuse . usually , however , the confidentiality issue for therapists treating antagonistic parents is more murky than clear , and sometimes , as in the following case , even appropriate efforts to establish protective agreements can go for naught . case ten. a psychologist anticipated possible ethical conflict between his providing marital therapy and being called to testify in a bitter divorce and custody battle . he had been asked by an attorney whose marriage was dissolving to counsel his wife and himself , in hopes that , for the sake of their young son , they could find a way to salvage their marriage . the psychologist agreed to work with them on the condition that whatever emerged during the marital therapy would not be accessible for inclusion in any subsequent legal proceedings . he explained to both parties that this condition was necessary to avoid either or both of them striving to look good in the psychologist eyes and make the other one look bad , which would undermine efforts to resolve their marital problems . both parties said that they understood and agreed with this condition . unfortunately , the marital problems proved refractory to the treatment , and two months following termination of the therapy , the attorney informed the psychologist that he was going to be subpoenaed as a witness to attest to his wife emotional instability . the psychologist reminded him of the pretreatment agreement , to which the attorney replied that this agreement carried no legal authority and could be revoked without consequence . the psychologist dealt with this impasse by letting the attorney lawyer know that , if called to testify , he would report to the court the husband violation of the pretreatment condition and appeal to the judge that the wife had not waived privilege . if the wife were to waive privilege , the psychologist continued , neither party would be happy with the testimony he would then give in describing his impressions of both of them . the attorney lawyer decided that it would be best to forgo calling the psychologist as a witness . sensible practice and case law do not preclude attorneys calling a psychotherapist as a fact witness . however , attorneys usually have no difficulty appreciating that privileged communication is essential for psychological treatment to be effective and that privacy calls for separating the therapist role from the expert witness role . nevertheless , to serve their own purposes , attorneys may press a fact witness psychotherapist for expert testimony . in so doing , they create a role conflict for the therapist , who may be required by the court to disclose information that he or she would ordinarily be ethically obliged to keep confidential . however , the ethics code allows disclosure of confidential information without consent of the individual  when mandated or permitted by law for valid purposes  . forensic psychologists must deal regularly with two related aspects of principled practice that warrant further elaboration . the first of these concerns the obligation of practitioners to prevent their personal values from affecting their professional conduct . the second aspect concerns the professional responsibility of forensic psychologists to resist expectations or demands of attorneys that , although falling within the law , run counter to psychology ethical principles and standards . the ethics code calls on psychologists to be cognizant of how their values as well as their limitations might affect their work . forensic practitioners must be conscientious not only in presenting the factual bases of their opinions and their level of certainty about their inferences but also by being sensitive to the possible impact of their personal needs and beliefs on their interpretation of the data . the nature and extent of this valuebased impact may not always be apparent , but being alert in every case to this possible threat to their integrity is no less important for forensic psychologists than being sufficiently competent to deal effectively with the substance of the case . this is not to say that experts will conduct their professional affairs completely free of prejudices derived from their values . however , it is one thing for psychologists to accept a case involving issues about which they have some opinion but nevertheless strive to remain objective and neutral in their work on the case ; it is quite something else for psychologists to seek out forensic opportunities in order to promote certain causes or advance some sociopolitical agenda , in which case their neutrality and objectivity would most certainly be suspect . as suggested by hess , experts should ask themselves several questions before committing to participate in a case in which their values might cloud their judgment : would they be using the expert role to provide objective expertise or to exercise moral advocacy ? are they qualified by knowledge , skills , education , experience , or training to provide information that will be helpful to the fact finders in the case ? will their involvement in the case be probative or prejudicial ? to what extent will the adversarial nature of the legal system distort the implications of whatever evidence they provide ? hence the ethical concern is not whether psychologists serving in expert roles have values but whether these values constitute a dedicated purpose that compromises the objectivity and neutrality they bring to their evaluations and testimony in certain cases . suppose , for example , that a male psychologist loses custody of his own child and subsequently becomes determined that no other father should lose custody of his child . in pursuit of this mission , he comes to believe that the father in every child custody case in which he consults should be awarded custody , and his reports always conclude that the father is the more suitable parent . this obvious intrusion of personal beliefs on professional conduct would have eroded the psychologist integrity , damaged the examinees , and undermined the legal process as well . forensic psychologists are entitled to their personal beliefs , including a conviction that fathers should always be awarded custody . however , proper platforms for promoting such causes might include a presentation to a legislative body or participation in a sociopolitical action group , but they do not include testifying as an expert witness . forensic practitioners who pursue a personal agenda or moral cause when objective opinion is expected and neutrality is required transgress ethical standards and invite malpractice claims . forensic psychologists should limit their expert witness involvement to cases in which they will have no difficulty suspending motivation to impose their own values , and they should neither seek nor accept professional opportunities to espouse partisan positions in the courtroom . forensic practitioners at times have to take responsibility for resisting attorney expectations and demands that reflect adversarial aspects of the judicial system and fall within the boundaries of the law but are not consistent with practicing principled forensic psychology . lawyers who try cases are accustomed to opposing each other , with a winner and a loser in each instance , and they are obliged to do whatever they can , within the rules of procedure and evidence , to win cases on behalf of their clients . this adversarial stance may define how some attorneys view their experts as well as their clients , in which case forensic psychologists must take care to avoid such consequent problems as inappropriate agency , multiple relationships , geographical intrusion , and misused expertise . inappropriate agency in forensic practice derives from the fact that lawyers are agents for their clients and are committed to working for their benefit . as one problematic consequence of this adversarial posture , attorneys may regard forensic psychologists they retain as likewise being agents for their clients who will advocate along with them on their behalf and share their commitment to winning their cases . except when forensic psychologists have been retained as consultants to provide behind-the-scenes advice on case management , rather than as expert witnesses , they must resist being inappropriately cast as agents for the attorney client . when they are retained to evaluate an attorney client and provide expert testimony , their client is the attorney who retained them , not the person they are evaluating , and they have no responsibility for serving this person best interests or advocating on his or her behalf . nor are forensic psychologists agents of the attorney who retains them , and they are no more responsible for serving the attorney best interests than they are for serving the best interests of the attorney client . forensic psychologists have no professional obligations to the parties in a case other than to conduct a competent evaluation and report their findings clearly , accurately , and honestly , whatever these findings may be , and independently of any motivation to win or lose . fisher argues in this regard that identifying who should and should not be considered the forensic psychologist client in a case is less important than having a clear sense of the practitioner ethical responsibilities to each of the parties in the case . however it might be defined , avoiding inappropriate agency and thus remaining free of an adversarial posture is an essential element of complying with the ethics code . if an examining psychologist findings appear to strengthen a retaining attorney case , all well and good ; should the findings seem likely to undermine the attorney chances of winning a case , this eventuality should be construed as the lawyer problem , not the psychologist problem , as in the following case . case eleven. the plaintiff in a personal injury case was seeking damages for allegedly experiencing an incapacitating stress disorder subsequent to being falsely accused of shoplifting in a department store . a psychological examination revealed few of the kinds of test patterns commonly found in persons with a stress disorder . to the contrary , the obtained data painted a picture of a psychologically resourceful woman with many personality strengths and aboveaverage capacity to deal with stressful situations without becoming unduly upset by them . the psychologist informed the retaining attorney that the results of the examination were likely to work against his client case . acting in accord with allowable adversarial procedures , the attorney declined to have a report written and did not identify the psychologist as an expert witness in the case , thereby shielding the psychologist information from discovery . to the psychologist surprise , however , the attorney thanked him for these seemingly unhelpful results . he had suspected some exaggeration on his client part and now had some dependable basis for attempting to persuade her to drop or at least reduce her claims , which would make it less difficult for him to represent her . concerning the potential for multiple relationships , attorneys may at times ask or expect practitioners to include therapeutic services in their work with a client they have referred for a forensic evaluation . at other times , an attorney may ask a client therapist if he or she would be willing to write an evaluation of the person for use in a forensic matter . the ethics code and the specialty guidelines urge practitioners to avoid such dual roles , out of concern that providing forensic and therapeutic services to the same or closely related individuals might impair their objectivity and risk doing harm to the recipient of their services . if asked to undertake concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services ,  forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider  . should practitioners be required by law , institutional policy , or external circumstances to serve in more than one role in a judicial or administrative proceeding , the guidelines recommend explaining the potential drawbacks of such multiple relationships and striving to minimize any negative consequences of the particular circumstance . as for geographical intrusion , lawyers are ordinarily free to bring both fact and expert witnesses into court from wherever they reside . psychologists are likewise free to give testimony wherever they are called upon to do so . however , should a forensic consultation involve conducting an evaluation or engaging in other activities that constitute practicing psychology , the provision of such services in a state in which one is not licensed is a geographical intrusion that can evoke ethical complaints or legal action . attorneys may not know or be concerned about this practice constraint when they retain out-of-state experts , but licensing laws can pose serious obstacles to practicing outside of states in which one is licensed . it falls to forensic psychologists to take responsibility for learning about and complying with the local regulations whenever they practice across state lines , and these regulations vary from state to state . as reported by goodstein , eleven states allow no practice at all by psychologists who are not licensed in their state ; twenty three states allow some practice by out-of-state psychologists , but only after prior approval by the state licensing board ; and most states that allow interstate practice with or without prior misused expertise is a regrettable turn of events that can occur as a consequence of attorneys being accustomed to an adversarial system in which everyone is entitled to a defense . psychologists may respect this tenet of the law , but they are not professionally bound by it , nor are they obliged to assist in a defense when it seems inadvisable or improper for them to do so . whereas lawyers may be assigned by the court or their firm to construct the best possible defense of a client , no matter how weak the case , forensic psychologists are ordinarily free to accept or decline requests to serve as an expert witness , as they see fit . in exercising this freedom , practitioners do well to avoid cases in which their expertise might be misused to shore up a foolish , poorly conceived , or contrived defense . testifying as an expert when psychological knowledge has little bearing on the issues in a case or , worse yet , when a manufactured defense borders on the psychologically absurd , can be damaging to a forensic psychologist reputation and reflect poorly on the profession . the practitioner in the following situation showed professional responsibility by declining to become involved in two cases that he anticipated could damage his reputation and the respectability of forensic psychology . case twelve. a psychologist received separate calls from two attorneys in a firm to which he had been recommended as a consultant . one of the attorneys wanted help with defending a student who had been caught cheating by copying answers from other students ’ examinations . the attorney had theorized that the cheater could not refrain from scanning his environment in search of answers due to an innate tendency that caused his eyes to wander . he sought to entice the psychologist participation by offering to work with him in developing this theory and going public with a  wandering eyes syndrome  that could bring both of them some degree of fame and fortune . the other attorney wanted to pursue whether an innate sensitivity to threat might justify his client having beaten his brother-in-law to death , before the brother-in-law could beat him to death , without their being any evidence that the murdered man had acted aggressively or in a threatening manner toward the client . the psychologist felt strongly that participating in either a wandering eyes syndrome defense or an innate threat sensitivity defense would constitute misuse of his professional expertise and expose him to ridicule in his professional community . preferring to preserve his reputation and reserve his testimony for cases in which his expertise would be used responsibly , he passed on the opportunity to participate in these cases . a few final words summarize the essentials of practicing principled forensic psychology in ways that minimize practitioners ’ vulnerability to ethical complaints and legal actions . adhere to the ethics code in general , attend in particular to ethical principles and standards having specific implications for providing forensic services , and be familiar with the forensic specialty guidelines . offer services that reflect proficiency achieved through knowledge , skills , education , training , and experience , and do not let this high level of competence erode over time . be conversant with the terminology , concepts , practices , and standards common in the legal community , and be acquainted with the regulations , statutes , and required or customary procedures pertaining to work in states in which the practitioner is licensed or permitted to practice . prepare accurate and sufficiently detailed records , store them securely , and retain them for at least the length of time specified by state requirements . be mindful of the forensic psychologist appropriate roles in a case , which may differ from what attorneys and attorneys ’ clients expect them to do , and be sensitive to conflicts of interest and other circumstances that could compromise principled practice . when confronting unfamiliar matters or an unexpected dilemma , consult with a respected colleague , and keep in mind that consulting relationships with attorneys can also provide helpful advice on the legal implications of certain forensic issues .

       "'In most jurisdictions, a custody or parenting evaluation will be ordered by the court or stipulated to by the parties. It results in appointment of one neutral evaluator focused on assessing all relevant issues in dispute. From a risk management per-spective, it is important to receive the court order before beginning the evaluation, as the authority to conduct the evaluation comes from the court. In many jurisdictions, the court order provides the evaluator with quasi-judicial immunity and includes information helpful to determining the scope of the evaluation. Additionally, the court order usually provides information about who is responsible for payment and identifies when the report is due, who is entitled to receive a copy, and the limits of confidentiality. After receiving the court order, it is common for the evaluator to have a joint conference call with the attorneys to gather basic information about the family and the reasons for the evaluation. Although some attorneys like to argue their case for the evaluator, it is best to get some basic facts and reasons for the evaluation during this call and lay out the logistics and proposed time frame for the evaluation. During this call, it is helpful for the evaluator to explain procedures and request documents to be reviewed.  The next step is scheduling initial appointments with the parents and sending them necessary paperwork, with copies to their attorneys. This paperwork is likely to include the retainer agreement and an intake form. As noted, the retainer agreement describes the evaluator’s and the parents’ obligations through the evaluation process, limitations regarding confidentiality, and other critical information about the evaluation process. It serves as a detailed informed consent document, which is recommended even if the parents have been ordered to participate in the evaluation.   INTERVIEWS WITH THE PARENTS'"

       "'conducting child custody and parenting evaluations . in the past thirty years , there has been a steady growth in the use of psychologists and other mental health professionals in child custody matters . evaluations conducted by psychologists assist the court in determining custody , decision making , access , and parenting plans when parents separate or divorce . at the same time , there has been an increase in the number of books devoted to child custody evaluations and broader forensic psychology practice . in considering the necessary ingredients of child custody and parenting evaluation practice , there are many areas in which a psychologist must gain proficiency . at a minimum , these include child development ; qualities of parenting ; divorce and the impact of the separation and divorce on families ; psychological assessment ; and  special issues ,  such as alienation of children , domestic violence , child abuse , relocation law , family dynamics in cases of extreme conflict , and personality dynamics that contribute to that extreme and ongoing conflict . finally , evaluators need to have a thorough understanding of the ethical issues that surface when undertaking these complex evaluations for families and the courts . these evaluations are time and cost intensive and potentially intrusive to the family , and they risk putting the children in the middle of their parents ’ conflicts . when ordered by the court to participate in an evaluation , parents are subjected to multiple interviews , perhaps psychological testing , and exposure of their conflicts to teachers , therapists , and other professionals . children are interviewed and observed in offices and their homes . this lengthy process typically takes three to four months to complete and yields a report that is potentially insightful and potentially damaging to the family . child custody and parenting evaluations are among the most difficult and challenging of all psychological evaluations . reasons for this include : the number of people and relationships in the family to be evaluated . the different ages of the children . the range of possible psychopathology . the presence of significant situational factors affecting psychological functioning . the limitations of psychological tests or interview methods designed for this type of assessment . the changing nature of a child developmental or psychological needs relative to future timesharing plans . the expansive nature of individual questions a court may have about a particular family . in addition to these complexities , child custody evaluators must have knowledge of relevant statutes and case law . the model standards of practice for child custody evaluation state that  evaluators should be knowledgeable about the legal and professional standards , laws , and rules applicable to the jurisdiction in which the evaluation is requested  . in addition , the guidelines for child custody evaluations in family law proceedings of the american psychological association , designed to provide guidance to those who perform child custody evaluations , direct that psychologists should strive to gain and maintain specialized knowledge , augment their existing skills , acquire sufficient understanding of the specialized child custody literature , and remain familiar with applicable legal standards in the relevant state in which they oneractice.1 the model standards state that the child custody evaluation process  involves the compilation of information and the formulation of opinions pertaining to the custody or parenting of a child and the dissemination of that information and those opinions to the court , to the litigants , and to the litigants ’ attorneys  . the goal of the guidelines for child custody evaluations  is to promote proficiency in the conduct of these particular evaluations  , and the purpose of the evaluation  is to assist in determining the psychological best interests of the child  . ultimately , the purpose of custody and parenting evaluations is to do all of these things . the evaluation process is associated with a dramatically increased risk of licensing complaints against the evaluator and is often stressful for the examiner . thus , evaluators must have the temperament to conduct very comprehensive evaluations and recognize that they may be subjected to anger from parents and an adversarial trial experience . distorted representations or accusations against the evaluator by one or both parents are not uncommon , both in complaints to the court and in complaints to licensing boards . because serious allegations are common to the types of cases that fail at mediation and other attempts at settlement , the evaluator recommendations can have particularly significant ramifications for the child future . although this chapter can not address all of the issues relevant to child custody and parenting evaluations , it focuses on these issues : the best interests of the child standard . the purpose of custody and parenting evaluations . ethical considerations . basic research the evaluator must know , especially about children and the impact of divorce on children . critical research in special issues , such as conflict between parents , alienated children , domestic violence , sexual abuse , and relocation . the process of custody and parenting evaluation . critical issues in report writing . it is incumbent on the child custody evaluator to be familiar with the law that governs these issues as they pertain to child custody . in nearly all fifty states and in most western countries , laws related to the best interests of the child guide decisions about child custody and parenting plans . few states define the term best interests of the child , although many identify specific factors that judges are to consider when making decisions about a child best interests , leading some commentators to argue that the best interests standard is not defined . indeed , judges are afforded great latitude to order a parenting plan that they decide is in the child best interests . lewis argued that  he elegance of the standard is the simultaneous focus on both the needs of the particular child and , with appropriate weight , the normative child development factors  . in jurisdictions where the legislature has identified several specific factors that the judge must consider , the weight assigned to each factor is left to the court . the evaluator task is to gather and present those psychological data related to the best interests factors and answer the questions posed by the court . in arizona , for example , several best interests factors call for psychological data to be gathered . they include : the wishes of the child as to custodian . the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child parent or parents , the child siblings , and any other person who may significantly affect the child best interests . the child adjustment to home , school , and community . which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent and meaningful continuing contact with the other parent . whether one parent , both parents , or neither parent has provided primary care of the child . although the evaluator gathers and analyzes data related to the best interests factors , the judge reaches the ultimate determination of the child best interests based on his or her discretion . in an effort to help judges weigh best interests factors in specific cases , a retired california superior court judge identified certain traits and issues that are common in divorcing families and suggested that these traits be appropriately weighted in specific cases . the traits include those listed next . quality of parenting . quality of coparenting . garbolino suggested that the factors likely to be of importance to the wellbeing of children vary across families and need to be weighed with discretion . regardless of whether a state has specific factors delineated in its best interests statute or whether there is a presumption associated with a particular factor , the ultimate decision about weighting of these factors is unique to each family and is left to judicial discretion . when completing an evaluation of a given family , the evaluator task is to provide a rationale as to why different factors might be more or less relevant with that particular family . this rationale , of course , will be reflected in the analysis of the data gathered and in the recommendations provided to the court . this analysis can assist the judge in considering and weighting the issues . this topic is discussed more fully in the section on report writing near the end of this chapter . purpose of a custody and parenting evaluation . for the court , the primary purpose of the evaluation is to assist the court in case a settlement is not reached . judges order child custody evaluations for a variety of reasons . these can include those circumstances in which there are significant allegations regarding drug and alcohol abuse , family violence , or child abuse , or significant mental health problems . often a judge is presented with two parents , both of whom appear good enough at parenting but who can not agree on a parenting plan . at other times , one or both parents appear to have significant problems . increasingly , judges look to mental health professionals to help them understand complex psychological questions of attachment between the child and his or her parents , sibling relationships , and the developmental needs of children . in a mobile society , one parent may wish to relocate with the children for a variety of reasons , such as employment , economics , family support , or a new relationship . judges may order a child custody evaluation to address the relevant psychological factors associated with the relocation question . for example , in california , judges frequently request the assistance of an evaluator in a relocation case in order to provide information to the court about the relevant psychological issues described in the lamusga decision . among the many issues identified in the case were various factors the court would likely consider in a relocation matter . this guidance from case law also helps custody evaluators in california focus on those relevant psychological issues . similar case law decisions in other states would guide custody evaluators as well . although judges are guided by the law in making decisions regarding the best interests of children , they may look to the child custody evaluator to assist in understanding the family dynamics and the relevant psychological factors in order to reach a decision about what is in the child best interests . in many ways , the neutrally appointed child custody evaluator serves as a consultant to the judge , providing critical data about the family for a better understanding of the family dynamics and the needs of the children . the majority of separating parents reach an agreement about parenting and custody issues on their own or with the assistance of their attorneys or legal processes , such as mediation . these parents agree on important decisions about their children , such as where they will go to school , what extracurricular activities they will participate in , and what nonemergency medical procedures to consider . they agree on a parenting plan that will delineate the times their children spend with each parent . obviously , these families do not need to undergo an evaluation , nor would the court order one . in fact , given the potentially intrusive nature of child custody evaluations , in such situations it is highly likely that an evaluation would be harmful to the family . however , as many as twenty percent of families at some point in time after separation experience high conflict . they can not agree on the parenting plan or how to make decisions for their child , nor are they able to focus on their child needs because of their mutual differences . these parents may disagree on seemingly simple and minor issues , such as what time a child exchange is to take place or whether it is appropriate for the children to eat certain foods . with many of these families , there are allegations of domestic violence or significant mental health problems , alienation or estrangement of children , or substance abuse . the primary value of an evaluation in these circumstances is that the evaluation provides an opportunity for parents to voice their concerns to a neutral expert . a neutrally appointed child custody evaluator will spend considerable time with both parents trying to understand their concerns and their perceptions of their child needs . this can be comforting to parents and sometimes serves as a catalyst for them to move toward cooperation . by listening to children , evaluators can also identify when they are caught in a loyalty conflict between their parents and describe the impact of this conflict to the parents and the court . it is common for children voices to be absent in the courts in the united states , and participation in a child custody evaluation can help children voice their concerns , share their wishes , and explore their feelings . although the child custody evaluator is not serving as a therapist , the evaluation process may be therapeutic to children who participate in the evaluation . if the evaluator concludes that the child is experiencing significant problems , he or she can refer the child for therapy and help the parents understand their child developmental needs . in these ways , the evaluator serves to hear the child voice and advocate for the child psychological and developmental needs . a third potential benefit comes from the fact that the same mental health professional is observing all family members . in the midst of an acrimonious divorce , services are often fragmented , with each parent having his or her own therapist and attorney whose role is to advocate for their respective client . these professionals do not have critical information about the other family members and are not neutral with regard to the family . although their advice might be helpful and appropriate to their clients , their perspectives and recommendations may not be in the child best interests . even a child therapist may not be serving the child best interests if the therapist is only seeing one parent with the child and becomes an advocate for that parent . by having a neutrally appointed child custody evaluator listen to and observe all family members , interview relevant collateral witnesses , and consider everyone input before reaching conclusions about the children best interests , fragmentation is reduced . at the end of the evaluation process , when an evaluator writes a comprehensive report , parents benefit by learning about their child needs and how they can work together to meet those needs . the report can help parents focus on the child rather than on their conflicts with each other and can help them learn ways to resolve their conflicts and meet their child needs . furthermore , the evaluator can help parents understand relevant issues important to parents , such as when and how to incorporate overnight time with each parent for their young child , the impact of their conflict on their children , and the risks and benefits of shared parenting . this understanding will enable them to parent more effectively . ultimately , an evaluation is most helpful to the family when the report and conclusions reduce conflict , help parents reach an agreement without going to trial , and keep parents focused on their child needs and best interests . welldone evaluations often help parents recognize the need for solution and compromise , and , while mediation may not have been successful prior to the evaluation , settlement may be much more likely after an evaluation . ethical considerations in child custody evaluations . along with any state or local court rules or statutes , and in addition to the afcc model standards and the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations described earlier , a number of other advisory documents guide the ethical practice of the child custody evaluator , including : ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct . applying psychology to civil proceedings . these documents provide considerable guidance for the evaluator . child custody evaluators who are not highly familiar with all of these documents are working at a considerable disadvantage and , therefore , are at increased risk for failing to maximally serve the court and family . maintaining specialized competence . child custody evaluations are a unique type of evaluation , one that requires specialized competence . eppcc standard two states ,  psychologists provide services . . . with populations and in areas only within the boundaries of their competence , based on their education , training , supervised experience , consultation , study , or professional experience  . the model standards list relevant areas for continuing education training for those performing child custody evaluations . the model standards list eighteen areas of expected training for all child custody evaluators and five areas of specialized training for those evaluators performing custody evaluations in those particular areas . these areas of expected training include , among other items : the psychological and developmental needs of children . the effects of separation , divorce , domestic violence , substance abuse , child alienation , child maltreatment , and interparental conflict on the psychological and developmental needs of children . how to assess parenting capacity and coparenting capacity and construct effective parenting and coparenting plans . additionally , the specialty guidelines state ,  forensic practitioners make ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competencies . . . keep abreast of developments in the fields of psychology and law  . these several documents guide the evaluator in developing and maintaining ongoing continuing education in areas relevant to child custody evaluations . avoiding conflicts of interest . the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations state ,  psychologists strive to avoid conflicts of interest and multiple relationships in conducting evaluations  , as certain prior roles may impair the objectivity of the child custody evaluator . furthermore , the guidelines for child custody evaluations advise against performing a child custody evaluation if the psychologist has provided therapeutic services to any of the parties in the past or present . evaluators may also consider disclosure of other preexisting professional roles with any family member such as having been the mediator ; personal relationships , such as having one child on the same little league team as the children in the family to be evaluated ; or even a close relationship with one of the attorneys before accepting an appointment . the appearance of conflict may be equally important to actual conflict in these cases . although there may not be any actual conflict , and although no ethics will have been violated by taking on the evaluation role in these circumstances , evaluators should recognize the risk that a parent who feels wronged by the evaluator recommendations might allege that the evaluator was biased because of these prior relationships . if such a parent later finds out about these relationships , it may serve as further reinforcement of such bias in the mind of the parent . advance disclosure of all prior relationships helps reduce the risk of such allegations . obtaining informed consent . even though child custody evaluations typically are courtordered , parents still need to understand the process . technically , informed consent is not obtained when the court orders an evaluation ; instead , custody evaluators are encouraged to obtain informed consent both in writing and orally at the start of the evaluation process . the document needs to explain critical issues , such as the general procedures that will be used , each parent role in the evaluation process , fees , and the limits of confidentiality . the evaluator needs to inform parents that a child custody evaluation is not a healthrelated procedure and that the evaluator will not bill a parent health insurance . additionally , because the eppcc requires psychologists to avoid doing harm when it is foreseeable , the evaluator should inform parents that one or both of them may be unhappy at the end of the evaluation process . it is recommended that the evaluator provide this document to the parents and their attorneys in advance of the start of the evaluation . finally , it is also important for the evaluator to inform potential collateral sources of the limits of confidentiality and the purpose for which the collateral information is being gathered . employing balanced and impartial procedures . according to afcc model standard five , child custody evaluators strive to use a balanced process in order to achieve objectivity , fairness , and independence : as one element of a balanced process , the evaluative criteria employed shall be the same for each parent–child combination . in the interests of fairness and sound methodology , evaluators shall ensure that any allegation concerning a matter that the evaluator is likely to consider in formulating his/her opinion shall be brought to the attention of the party against whom the allegation is registered so that s/he is afforded an opportunity to respond . when the evaluator does not act in this way , it almost assuredly leads to a complaint of bias , sometimes made to the parent attorney , but potentially to the court or practitioner licensing board . using multiple sources of information . according to guideline ten of the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations ,  multiple methods of data gathering enhance the reliability and validity of psychologists ’ eventual conclusions , opinions , and recommendations . unique as well as overlapping aspects of various measures contribute to a fuller picture of each examinee abilities , challenges , and preferences  . these multiple methods usually include , at a minimum : multiple interviews with the parents . interviews with children when appropriate . observations of children and parents interacting . administration of psychological testing and parenting questionnaires . review of collateral documents . interviews with relevant professionals , family members , and friends . staying within the scope of the evaluation . guideline eight of the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations states : before agreeing to conduct a child custody evaluation , psychologists seek when necessary to clarify the referral question and to determine whether they are potentially able to provide opinions or recommendations . it may be helpful to have psychologists ’ understanding of the scope of the evaluation confirmed in a court order , or by stipulation of all parties and their legal representatives . evaluators shall establish the scope of the evaluation as determined by court order or by a signed stipulation by the parties and their attorneys . if issues not foreseen at the outset of the evaluation arise and if it is the evaluator professional judgment that the scope of the evaluation must be widened , the evaluator shall seek the approval of the court or all attorneys prior to going beyond the originally designated scope of the evaluation . both of these require that the evaluator carefully consider the relevant issues in the case and make recommendations consistent with those issues . identifying the scope in advance of performing the evaluation also ensures that the evaluator has the necessary specialized training to conduct the evaluation , as noted earlier . differentiating observations , inferences , and conclusions . in the specialty guidelines , psychologists are reminded :  in their communications , forensic practitioners strive to distinguish observations , inferences , and conclusions . forensic practitioners are encouraged to explain the relationship between their expert opinions and the legal issues and facts of the case at hand  . additionally , specialty guideline eleven states ,  forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose all sources of information obtained in the course of their professional services , and to identify the source of each piece of information that was considered and relied upon in formulating a particular conclusion opinion  . ultimately , this guideline is to help parents understand the rationale for recommendations but also to assist the court in understanding the evaluator reasoning . within this context , it is equally important to provide a description of the risks and benefits of different options available to the court . this topic is discussed in greater detail in the report writing section further on . record keeping . because records are subject to subpoena and full disclosure is important in the interest of transparency and due process , the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations direct evaluators to keep complete , readable records with the expectation that others will review them in the event of ongoing litigation after the completion of the report : legal and ethical standards describe requirements for the appropriate development , maintenance , and disposal of professional records . the court expects psychologists providing child custody evaluations to preserve the data that inform their conclusions . this enables other professionals to analyze , understand , and provide appropriate support for psychologists ’ forensic opinions . basic critical and relevant research , especially about children . given the admonition about training , this next section addresses basic research with which all custody evaluators should be familiar . divorce research . the impact of divorce on children has been studied for more than thirty years . global findings include that there is an increased risk of harm to children when their parents divorce and that most of the harm comes from the children exposure to poverty , conflict , limited access to one of their parents , and poor parenting . research also demonstrates that children are resilient and that the majority suffer no significant negative longterm effects as a result of the separation or divorce of their parents . children benefit when they are exposed to limited parental conflict and have regular and frequent contact with both of their  goodenough  parents , and when both parents can participate in a wide range of their child life experiences and activities . parenting plans for young children . the term parenting plans refers to both the legal custody and physical custody of children . legal custody refers to who has the authority to make important decisions about the children , whereas physical custody refers to where the children reside . some states , however , have changed statutory language and no longer use terms such as legal custody , physical custody , and visitation . in those states , statutory language refers to the child residential schedule and parents ’ decision making . this section of the chapter focuses on the residential schedule identified in parenting plans . before two thousand , much of the divorce literature suggested that very young children should not have overnight visits with their  noncustodial parent  until sometime between the ages of three and five . j. b. kelly and lamb were the first to identify the importance of regular overnight visits between very young children and their parents . this article led to some controversy , and in recent years , it has again been suggested that overnight visits may be harmful for some children . gould and stahl provided a framework in which to consider risks and benefits associated with overnight visits . most recently , ludolph and dale surveyed the attachment , fathering , and divorce research and concluded that , although attachment is one factor to consider when designing parenting plans for young children , other factors , including the history and nature of father involvement , quality of parenting by each parent , extent and type of conflict between the parents , regular day care that might be provided by third parties , and logistics , are relevant as well . if conducting a child custody evaluation where young children are at issue , it is critical to know this research . conflict , legal custody , and decision making . less research has focused on legal custody and decision making between parents than on residential schedules . for most parents , conflict decreases over time . in most circumstances , parents will share in the legal custody and decision making for their children , but there will be times when this is not feasible . typically , in families experiencing coercivecontrolling violence , in situations where mental illness and/or substance abuse impairs parenting , and in those families in which parents dislike each other more than they love their children , it may be necessary to have decision making vested in one parent . when this is necessary , it is primarily so that decisions can be made in a timely and conflictfree way . parenting coordinators , who work with a family to help resolve conflicts on an ongoing basis , usually after there are court orders in place , may prove of value when certain highconflict dynamics exist . this process helps many families avoid frequent returns to court and enables decisions to be made for the benefit of children more efficiently . critical research in special issues . in addition to the basic research just described , many child custody evaluations involve special issues , including allegations of domestic violence , sexual abuse , children becoming alienated , and relocation . even more specialized knowledge is critical when performing evaluations in these areas ) . alienated children . first discussed by wallerstein and j. b. kelly as children who refused visitation with one parent , gardner described what he termed parental alienation syndrome , a phenomenon he described as occurring when a mother who harbored extremely negative feelings about the father influenced the child to reject the father . j. b. kelly and johnston discussed  the alienated child  and identified a range of factors that result in children becoming alienated from a parent . drozd and olesen took this is a step further when identifying the differences between children who are realistically estranged from one parent and those who have developed an unjustified alienation in rejecting that parent . more recently , a special issue of family court review was devoted to the topic of alienation with a special focus on intervention . domestic violence . with research suggesting that nearly half of all divorcing families experience some type of domestic violence , it is not surprising that many child custody evaluations involve such allegations . for many years , the domestic violence literature focused primarily on what has been termed intimate partner violence , and the child custody evaluation literature focused on risk assessments with these families . however , not all domestic violence involves the use of power and control as a primary dynamic such as is found in coercive controlling violence . in two thousand and seven , the afcc and the national council of juvenile and family court judges convened a symposium to discuss the differentiation of domestic violence cases and develop a recognition that one size does not fit all . this resulted in a more nuanced understanding of family violence and the range of parenting plan options appropriate for these different families . differentiation of types of domestic violence suggests that , in some families , violence is unique to the separation of the parents . in these cases , after violence occurs , parents are ashamed of their actions , readily admit to what they have done , and vow never again to engage in violent or abusive behavior . in other families , parents experience situational couples violence , in which neither parent is afraid of the other , both initiate the violence , and there is no evidence of power and control being utilized by either parent . in perhaps the smallest subset of families , but in the most serious of situations , the violence appears to be coercive and controlling in nature . in these coercivecontrolling violence families , it is most common for males to aggress , the victim and children are fearful in response to physical violence , and there is often cooccurring emotional abuse , sexual abuse , or control of family economics . sexual abuse . perhaps the most emotionally charged of cases are those in which there are allegations of child sexual abuse . the challenge in these cases is that the allegation usually sets in motion several events , including but not limited to : independent investigations by child protective services and law enforcement authorities . criminal charges . a temporary order suspending or supervising contact between the child and the alleged offender . emotionally charged court hearings in which the alleged offender denies the allegations and claims the allegations are made for purposes of custody and the other parent simply claiming protection of the child . a child custody evaluation designed to more fully evaluate the allegations and make recommendations for a parenting plan . kuehnle and connell focus on the range of hypotheses that must be considered in any case when such allegations are raised and the thoroughness of the evaluation process required . they also identify that the primary role of the evaluator is to perform a risk assessment in these cases . relocation evaluations . the one area where many judges and evaluators have the most trouble making decisions is in relocation cases , which pit the right of adults to live wherever they want and the right to parent . these cases come to the court when one parent wants to move with the child and the other parent opposes the move and wants the child to remain . child custody evaluators are at risk of confounding the research when performing these evaluations by recommending against moves because of research that demonstrates the benefit to children when both parents maintain ongoing and regular access with their children . there is limited research on the effect of parental relocation on children . college students reported greater current problems when they lived more than one hundred miles from their other parent during their childhood as a result of the relocation of either parent . drawing on other divorce research but in the absence of relocation research , some have suggested courts allow relocation by the primary custodial parent whereas others have suggested that courts should almost routinely order a provisional change of custody to the parent who is not relocating when the primary custodial parent wants to move . stahl has suggested that for-the-move or against-the-move biases operate in those circumstances and should not result in either of these presumptions . the primary focus in recent years has been on the consideration of risk and protective factors in determining the ultimate decision in these cases . some factors are likely to increase risks for children if they move . other factors will be protective and minimize risks for children if they move . some children who move are harmed while others are not . parkinson et al . wrote that , while it is tempting to resolve these difficult cases with the assistance of wishful thinking , research is needed to test that wishful thinking against the realities of experience . they do not believe there is ample research support to conclude that children who relocate with one parent while the other parent is left behind will , by virtue of the relocation , automatically do well or will be harmed . rather , the only way to understand the optimal relocation decision in a given case is by focusing on the risk and protective factors existing in that case . process of conducting custody and parenting evaluations . child custody and parenting evaluations are very different from other psychological or forensic evaluations . they are more complex , involve more people , and entail more procedures than most . these evaluations require a forensic mindset versus a therapeutic mindset and the exploration of multiple hypotheses . typically , there will be allegations made by one parent against the other , and it is not unusual for the evaluator to be unable to reach conclusions about the hesaid , shesaid allegations in the case . each step of the evaluation process is designed to help the evaluator gather information critical to understanding the family . this section addresses some of these critical issues . in most jurisdictions , a custody or parenting evaluation will be ordered by the court or stipulated to by the parties . it results in appointment of one neutral evaluator focused on assessing all relevant issues in dispute . from a risk management perspective , it is important to receive the court order before beginning the evaluation , as the authority to conduct the evaluation comes from the court . in many jurisdictions , the court order provides the evaluator with quasijudicial immunity and includes information helpful to determining the scope of the evaluation . additionally , the court order usually provides information about who is responsible for payment and identifies when the report is due , who is entitled to receive a copy , and the limits of confidentiality . after receiving the court order , it is common for the evaluator to have a joint conference call with the attorneys to gather basic information about the family and the reasons for the evaluation . although some attorneys like to argue their case for the evaluator , it is best to get some basic facts and reasons for the evaluation during this call and lay out the logistics and proposed time frame for the evaluation . during this call , it is helpful for the evaluator to explain procedures and request documents to be reviewed . the next step is scheduling initial appointments with the parents and sending them necessary paperwork , with copies to their attorneys . this paperwork is likely to include the retainer agreement and an intake form . as noted , the retainer agreement describes the evaluator and the parents ’ obligations through the evaluation process , limitations regarding confidentiality , and other critical information about the evaluation process . it serves as a detailed informed consent document , which is recommended even if the parents have been ordered to participate in the evaluation . interviews with the parents . a good way to start the first evaluation interview with each parent is to ask the parent ,  why are we here ?  this question allows the parent to explain his or her concerns , observations , beliefs , and allegations in a rather openended manner . with limited prompting , the evaluator can spend much of the first appointment trying to understand the parent issues , concerns , and proposed solutions . parents often have a need to be heard , and focusing on the matters important to them during the first interview facilitates cooperation and participation . during the interviews , it is important for the evaluator to focus on each parent : concerns and allegations . responses to the allegations and concerns raised by the other parent . understanding of the child and his or her psychological , social , academic , and developmental functioning . description of the history of the relationship between the child and each parent . description of his or her own family history , especially focusing on relevant issues that may relate to the current evaluation . beliefs about the strengths and weaknesses of his or her own and the other parent parenting . description of the coparenting relationship and the ability of each parent to communicate with the other and make day-to-day decisions on behalf of the children . history of and ability to support the child relationship with the other parent and if there are concerns about this moving forward . understanding of the special issues in the case and how it may affect a parenting plan . recommendation for the specific parenting plan . in most evaluations , this information can be gathered in three to four interviews , each of which might last two hours . it is important to gather the information that each parent wants to relay , but the examiner must be more than a stenographer and seek enough depth and breadth associated with these issues while simultaneously having an opportunity to ask each parent about the concerns raised by the other parent . in evaluations with more complex issues , the evaluator will want to explore those in depth . for example , in a case with allegations of domestic violence , it is important to understand the parents ’ description of the history of conflict resolution , whether there are issues of power and control , and the parents ’ description of physical , verbal , and emotional abuse that may have occurred . if a parent describes physical violence , it is important to ask about the first , most recent , and worst incidents of abuse . it is always important to explore for more than what the parent initially describes , since many domestic violence victims are reluctant to share details of the abuse . in cases with allegations of alienation , it is important to explore each parent history of involvement with the child , each parent perception of his or her own and the other parent contribution to the child being alienated , and the extent to which the child is rigid in his or her rejection of one parent . the evaluator should explore whether the child has a realistic basis for being estranged from one parent or whether other dynamics are contributing to this alienation . finally , in relocation cases , in addition to best interests statutes , it is important to understand specific statutory or case law pertaining to relocation . in some jurisdictions , there is a presumptive right to move by a custodial parent , whereas in other jurisdictions , the burden is on the parent requesting to relocate to show that the move is in the child best interests . in still other jurisdictions , every relocation matter is considered on a de novo basis . evaluators need to understand these statespecific legal issues in relocation matters . when interviewing parents in relocation cases , evaluators must : ask questions to understand the motives for relocation and the motives for opposing it . understand how each parent perceives the child will be affected by the move , both positively and negatively . collect family information to understand the social capital in each community . gather information from each parent about a proposed parenting plan should the court allow the move , or should the court not allow the move , or should both parents end up in the same location . interviews with the children . interviews with the children are a crucial part of understanding both the family dynamics and the relationship between the child and his or her parents . evaluators should : start by establishing rapport with the children . begin by discussing the process of the evaluation , the limits of confidentiality , and the structure of the interview process . encourage children to talk openly about their feelings and help them understand that the evaluation is about their interests and not their parents ’ wishes . inform the children that a report will be submitted to the judge , which the parents will probably read . tell children that they do not have to answer questions they do not want to answer and that their parents or the judge will ultimately decide where and how they will spend time with their parents . evaluators must recognize that children language skills are not the same as adults ’ . it is important to know that , although children often do not understand their questions , they may respond as if they do . it may be useful to ask children to repeat or to explain the questions to be sure that they understand them . how questions are asked affects the way answers are given . when interviewing children , particularly in a forensic context , it is vital to ask openended questions . these questions are far more likely to yield useful , accurate , and honest responses . asking leading or categorical questions limits the way that the child responds and , therefore , limits the usefulness and validity of those responses . it is important for the evaluation process to be balanced . as such , it is also important for children to be seen with each parent bringing them to the office . evaluators must keep in mind that one or both parents may influence their children . to reduce the risks associated with this influence , appointments should be scheduled equally with each parent bringing the children to the appointments . although children suggestibility and the potential for being influenced by parents or siblings is a topic that is beyond the scope of this chapter , it is critical for those evaluating custody and parenting plans to understand this research . specific data are important to gather during interviews with children . these include the child : likes and dislikes , interests , friends , chosen activities , and other aspects of the child day-to-day life . schooling , including information about how each parent participates in helping with homework and other schoolrelated matters . perceptions of his or her relationships with each parent , including things that the child likes and does not like about each parent . perceptions of discipline . routines in each home and how the child deals with any differences in routines between homes . typical mood , and how the child typically expresses his or her feelings and if there is a difference for each parent . perceptions about the need to care for his or her parents emotionally . anything else the child wants the judge to know . these data provide important information to the court about the child life . because the evaluator is the only unbiased person providing information to the judge about the child , such information is vital to the court in helping it to make the ultimate decision about custody and parenting plans . observing parents and children together . a fundamental purpose for observing children is to understand the nature of the bond between a child and the parents . although there is no reliable and valid way of measuring whether a child is more bonded to one parent or the other , the job of the evaluator is to describe the behavioral dynamics of the bond for the judge . in young children , the evaluator should observe the way children and parents relate with one another . do they play together , smile and laugh with one another , exchange affection with one another , or stay relatively distant and isolated from one another ? does the child seem attentive to the parent when the parent enters the room , or does the child seem disinterested ? when parents are in the room , it is important to listen to what they say . parents may want to talk about things that are inappropriate to discuss in front of the child , because they have a need to provide more information to the examiner . the observation session is not a good time for this so it is always important for evaluators to understand each parent ability to utilize adequate boundaries and keep the child free from anxiety . if the parent offers inappropriate comments in front of the child , the examiner should try to understand how the child feels about it , responds to it , and interacts with the parent about it . for example , some children get into arguments with their parents about things that parents say , and this provides valuable information about the interaction between parent and child . it is often helpful to provide tasks for the parent and child to complete . encouraging a father and daughter to draw a picture , for example , will provide data about how they work together to complete a task . are they cooperative , are they playful , do they use each other assistance , or do they become quite competitive with one another ? this can help the evaluator develop hypotheses about the child relationship with the parent , which will need to be verified in other ways . unstructured play , in which the child initiates an activity of his or her choosing , provides an opportunity to see how responsive the parent is to the child in his or her space . many parents can interact quite well with their children when they choose the activity , but they may feel awkward and insecure when their children choose the activity . at the same time , the examiner must observe the affect of the parents and children . are they relaxed and having fun , or is there tension between the parent and child just as there is between the parents ? finally , with older children and their parents , it is important to talk about the routines , day-to-day life in each parent home , and how they and their parents deal with conflicts . examiners should pay particular attention to disparities between what the child says during individual interviews compared with the observation sessions . it is particularly important to explore a range of feelings between the child and parents in those families where alienation or estrangement is alleged . psychological testing and parenting questionnaires . use of psychological testing in custody evaluations , although common , is not mandatory . no psychological tests measure the quality of parenting or coparenting , which are critical issues in child custody and parenting evaluations . there are also no valid psychological tests designed for use with the specific child custody population . although there have been efforts to develop some psychological instruments relevant to child custody , these instruments are of limited validity . the most recent effort to develop an instrument to understand children views of their relationships , the structured child assessment of relationships in families , does not have sufficient validity and reliability , although research on this instrument is ongoing . thus , no specific instruments can directly assess the complex issues inherent in these evaluations . the afcc model standards direct child custody evaluators to  be prepared to articulate the bases for selecting the specific instruments used  and to use assessment instruments  for the purpose for which they have been validated  . the model standards add that  aution should be exercised . . . when utilizing computergenerated interpretive reports and/or prescriptive texts  . according to the apa guidelines for child custody evaluations ,  psychologists strive to interpret assessment data in a manner consistent with the context of the evaluation  . these standards and guidelines suggest that child custody and parenting evaluators must be careful in choosing assessment instruments , understand the research associated with custody litigants and their scores on various measures , and be careful when using computergenerated interpretive reports . if a psychologist quotes from a computergenerated interpretive report , he or she should identify it as a quote and provide the citation . psychologists regularly administer psychological testing as part of a comprehensive , multimethod process of child custody evaluation . the minnesota multiphasic personality twonventory2 is the most commonly utilized psychological test administered to parents . other commonly administered psychological tests include the personality assessment inventory , the rorschach inkblot test , and the millon clinical multiaxial inventoryiii . there is considerable controversy about using either the mcmiiii or rorschach in child custody work . examiners should be aware of the controversies and arguments on both sides of the issues when choosing to use those particular instruments , as presented in balanced reviews by craig , dyer , erard , and evans and schutz . finally , psychological test instruments should be used in a forensically informed manner . unlike the use of psychological tests in therapeutic settings , where the goal is to aid in diagnosis and treatment , tests in child custody and parenting evaluations should be  informed  by the forensic questions that guide the evaluation . questions pertaining to each parent general psychological and behavioral functioning , as it relates to their functional parenting and coparenting capacities , are common reasons for utilizing tests in parenting evaluations . the test data should be used to develop hypotheses about the parent psychological and behavioral functioning specifically in terms of how it relates to parenting and abilities to implement a parenting plan . for example , if test data revealed clinical elevations on a scale that measures psychological turmoil , the evaluator might hypothesize that the parent is reacting to a difficult divorce , and if this hypothesis was confirmed by other data gathered during the evaluation , the impact on parenting might be deemed minimal and temporary . alternatively , it might be hypothesized that the parent has chronic and pervasive deficits in mood regulation , which would pose more serious concerns with respect to parenting and coparenting . the hypotheses generated are evaluated against other data from the evaluation to either confirm or disconfirm those hypotheses . it is also common to administer some type of parenting questionnaires or instruments to gauge a parent stress , measure each parent selfreport about his or her relationship with the child , and gather structured information about the child . it is important to recognize that these instruments are not definitive but also may provide useful hypotheses about the parents and their observations of their child . review of collateral information . collateral information falls within two major categories . first , the evaluator will review relevant pleadings , declarations , and other court documents that the attorneys submit . although these documents are not intended to bring  truth  to the case , they do provide a framework from which to understand each parent perspectives and concerns . evaluators must review all materials submitted , though the evaluator can set a deadline as to when materials must be submitted so the evaluation can be completed on time as required by the court . the second type of collateral information comes from third parties who have relevant information about one or more family members . collateral data can include information gathered from friends , relatives , babysitters , teachers , pediatricians , psychotherapists , and others . the child custody evaluator looks for convergent and divergent data between collateral and other data to help in understanding the various allegations and assertions made by the parties . collateral information can be gathered verbally as well as in writing , with the use of questionnaires and letters , or by a review of affidavits or other written statements of the parties . the benefits of gathering collateral information are listed next . evaluators need to have a mindset of disconfirmation rather than confirmation . reviewing collateral information and talking with collateral sources allows for that . parents in the midst of a custody dispute tend to present themselves in the most favorable light and the other parent more negatively . collateral data can help balance this defensiveness and positive impression management by the parents . collateral data may include information about parents and/or children that can not be obtained through clinical interview , testing , and observation . collateral data can help verify or refute claims made by the parents or others . the afcc model standards provide specific direction for the gathering of collateral data : evaluators shall be mindful of the importance of gathering information from multiple sources in order to thoroughly explore alternative hypotheses concerning issues pertinent to the evaluation . evaluators shall recognize the importance of securing information from collateral sources who , in the judgment of the evaluators , are likely to have access to salient and critical data . when assessing the reports of participants in the evaluation , evaluators shall seek from other sources information that may serve either to confirm or disconfirm participant reports on any salient issue , unless doing so is not feasible . in utilizing collateral sources , evaluators shall seek information that will facilitate the confirmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses under consideration . all collateral sources contacted shall be disclosed by the child custody evaluator . austin recommended that child custody evaluators use a concentric circle approach for gathering collateral data . he identified that there are people who are close to the family who will have the richest and most complete information about family members . at the same time , these persons are likely to be the most biased and to take sides in the dispute . in the second , broader circle are professionals such as teachers , day care professionals , pediatricians , and therapists who may have considerable information about the family but only within the narrow areas of knowledge that they experience family members . many of these persons may also be biased in favor of one parent . in the outermost circle are those few people who may know very little about the family but may have very specific information about an event or some particular parent–child information . this may include someone at the school who overhears an argument between a parent and the child teacher . these persons may have very critical information about a specific event that was witnessed but know absolutely nothing else about any of the family members . typically , the court order appointing a child custody evaluator allows the evaluator to speak with any thirdparty collateral sources chosen , even without the expressed permission of either parent . authorization from parents is required before speaking with professional collateral sources , such as teachers , therapists , and physicians . evaluators must obtain the consent of the collateral witness to be part of the evaluation process and provide the same information about the limitations to confidentiality to all thirdparty collaterals , some of whom may not want to speak with an evaluator if they know that their comments are going to be included in a report to the court and read by the parents . as stated in the afcc model standards ,  evaluators shall provide potential collateral informants with written information that shall include an unambiguous statement concerning the lack of confidentiality in a forensic mental health evaluation  . applying psychology to civil proceedings . critical issues in report writing . in any presentation of findings , the evaluator must : summarize the datagathering procedures , information sources , and time spent , and present all relevant information , including information that does not support the conclusions reached ; describe any limitations in the evaluation that result from unobtainable information , failure of a party to cooperate , or the circumstances of particular interviews ; only make a custody or visitation recommendation for a party who has been evaluated . this requirement does not preclude the evaluator from making an interim recommendation that is in the best interest of the child ; and provide clear , detailed recommendations that are consistent with the health , safety , welfare , and best interest of the child if making any recommendations to the court regarding a parenting plan . although this rule is mandatory only for california child custody evaluators , these suggestions are useful for evaluators in any jurisdiction . the specialty guidelines state : consistent with relevant law and rules of evidence , when providing professional reports and other sworn statements or testimony , forensic practitioners strive to offer a complete statement of all relevant opinions that they formed within the scope of their work on the case , the basis and reasoning underlying the opinions , the salient data or other information that was considered in forming the opinions , and an indication of any additional evidence that may be used in support of the opinions to be offered . the specific substance of forensic reports is determined by the type of psycholegal issue at hand as well as relevant laws or rules in the jurisdiction in which the work is completed . the specialty guidelines also instruct the forensic evaluator to disclose data and information that is not supportive of or contrary to the conclusions and recommendations offered by the evaluator . procedures . based on the need to demonstrate balance and neutrality and to help the court understand that the evaluation process was thorough , the evaluator must explain all procedures and describe the length of appointments and the place where interviews and observations occurred . materials reviewed must be described , and all collaterals who were interviewed must be listed . if certain procedures could not be completed , such as a stepparent who refused to be interviewed or a collateral witness who would not return phone calls , this should be described . if there was some reason that procedures were not balanced , this discrepancy should be explained . this thorough description of procedures helps reduce the risk that someone might perceive the evaluation and report as biased . each parent . the evaluator must provide complete and relevant information about each parent . among other things , the data included in this section of the report should include each parent : concerns and allegations . responses to the other parent stated significant concerns . description of the children , the children functioning , and needs . relevant history and psychological functioning . parenting style and strengths and weaknesses . description of the coparenting relationship and each parent contribution to the coparenting difficulties . desired custodial outcome and reasons for that . in addition , this section should include each parent relevant details about any special issues . for example , in a relocation evaluation , it will be important for the evaluator to explain each parent motives for moving or opposing the move , thoughts about how the move might be positive or harmful for the child , and other important relocationrelated data . children . the report should provide thorough and relevant information about each child . the examiner must keep in mind that this is likely to be the only opportunity the court will have to gain a truly objective perspective of the children and their adjustment . among other things , the data should include information about each child : developmental , social , psychological , academic , and social functioning , including interests , friendships , temperament , and typical mood . relationship history with each parent . thoughts about each parent . feelings about a range of things , including the parents ’ divorce and their behaviors as divorced parents . applying psychology to civil proceedings . exposure to parental conflicts , and/or the extent to which the child feels alienated or justifiably estranged from one parent . perspective of each parent caretaking and how each parent disciplines the child . opinion about the parenting plan , if expressed . collateral information . the evaluator must present information obtained from collateral sources and indicate whether this information was obtained in writing or verbally . data about why the collateral informant information was included in the data set , the nature and type of relationship the collateral informant has with the parties and/or children , and , if relevant , the attitude of the collateral informant about participating in the evaluation should be provided . a common complaint of parents is that the evaluator misrepresented what collateral informants offered . for this reason , it may be useful to review with the collateral informant the information to be included in the report and/or include a statement from each collateral witness confirming the information in the report . analysis . the analysis section is the most important component of the report . rather than a review of information already described , the analysis section should focus on those data that lead to the expert opinions . in the analysis section , it is also important to discuss data that may not be consistent with the examiner expert opinions or recommendations . just as in math class , here it is important to show your work and explain the bases for all conclusions . it is important to detail the basis for any expert opinions reached . the analysis section should reflect that the evaluator considered each parent concerns and responses to the other parent concerns . it is important that those data are integrated with the psycholegal issues of concern to the court . given that , in most evaluations , there is a range of custodial options , it is important for the evaluator to provide a thorough riskbenefit analysis of each custodial option and those data that support his or her conclusions . for example , in a typical case , the evaluator should explain the risks and benefits of primarymother custody , primaryfather custody , and shared custody and the risks and benefits associated with substantial versus equal time with each parent . in a relocation case , the examiner should explain the risks and benefits of primarymother custody in location x as opposed to the risks and benefits of primaryfather custody in location y. finally , in all cases , the evaluator should explain the risks and benefits of shared decision making as opposed to some other plan that may give one parent decisions in certain areas of the child life or perhaps even utilizing a parenting coordinator . in some cases , it might be best to provide the court with detailed parenting plans reflecting different options rather than a single recommended parenting plan . in such a case , the evaluator should detail the risks and benefits of each potential parenting plan in the report . finally , and most important , it is critical to present both the data that support the conclusions as well as the data that do not support the conclusions . recommendations . in recent years , there has been a renewed debate about whether examiners should make recommendations about the ultimate issue in child custody cases . judges typically prefer recommendations , and therefore it remains the custom of evaluators to provide them . nevertheless , it is clearly the judge job to make orders based on all of the evidence at trial rather than simply rubberstamping the recommendations of a child custody evaluator . family law judges use the evaluator recommendations as a starting place , not an end point , and they assess the usefulness of the evaluator recommendations based on the consistency with other evidence presented at trial as well as the forensic integrity and quality of the evaluator work product . stahl suggested that , when one or more best interests or protective factors would suggest in favor of the child relocation and one or more best interests or risk factors would suggest against the child relocation , the evaluator should not weigh the various factors ; this is the judge job . instead , in such situations , the evaluator should provide those conclusions to the court and provide multiple recommendations , with the ultimate decision based on the judge weighting of the various best interests , risk , and protective factors . in addition to the ultimate issue of parenting time , it is common in child custody evaluations to make recommendations in these areas : legal custody and/or decision making . interventions , including counseling for either parent and/or the children , identifying the suggested goals for that counseling . substance abuse or domestic violence related interventions , if relevant . alternative dispute resolution for ongoing issues . any other recommendations relevant to the family that was evaluated . child custody evaluations are complex and require integrating disparate information gathered from a variety of participants and information of various types with disparate characteristics . like a jigsaw puzzle , child custody evaluations require a persistent attitude of gathering more information , not only to confirm but also to disconfirm various hypotheses , until things fall into place . evaluators need to avoid acting like stenographers and maintain a style of curiosity , always gathering additional relevant information until complex issues are understood . to be an effective evaluator , one must develop a thick skin , because one or both parents are likely to be upset with the recommendations . in some jurisdictions , it is not uncommon for parents to file licensing complaints alleging bias or unprofessional behavior regardless of how thorough and professional the evaluation is . indeed , the child custody evaluator carries more risk for licensing complaints than any other role played by the professional psychologist . finally , if a case goes to trial , it is possible that one or both attorneys might hire a consultant or testifying expert who might criticize some of the work . in spite of the risks and difficulties , conducting child custody evaluations can be professionally rewarding and satisfying . a child custody evaluator provides a beneficial service for family law judges that can help them understand the complexities of the most conflicted families they serve . child custody evaluations can provide guidance for families who can settle their dispute and move forward following a welldone evaluation . because child custody evaluators work in an interdisciplinary field , opportunities for ongoing learning and professional development are ever present . most important , child custody evaluators keep the focus on the best interests of the children and therefore help them and their parents to adjust to the change in their lives as they develop healthier and more adaptive ways of moving forward .

       "'In most cases, the forensic examiner is retained by the attorney who represents one of the parties in the litigation. Contact usually is initiated by telephone. The attorney typically identifies the party he or she represents, describes the case in general terms, and inquires about the expert’s experience and knowledge as it relates to the issues involved. The attorney also identifies the other parties and attorney(s) involved in the litigation to determine if the expert has a conflict of interest. The attorney then asks about the expert’s interest in accepting the referral. The expert should clarify the role he or she is expected to play—that is, testifying expert or consultant—to ensure that there are no misunderstandings. Fees should be discussed in this initial conversation. The expert should request a financial retainer from the attorney along with a letter of agreement outlining the scope of the expert’s projected involvement and payment arrangements. The expert should request that the retaining attorney provide all available records relating to the case, but the expert should not begin working on the case until the retainer and letter of agreement have been received. It is important to understand that the attorney, not the examinee, is the expert’s client. As mentioned earlier, if the expert is to examine the plaintiff and offer testimony, the expert’s commitment is to objectivity and impartiality, not to advocating for the retaining attorney’s client.

       "'conducting personal injury evaluations . unlike criminal proceedings in which the government charges an individual with having committed an unlawful act , civil proceedings involve disputes between private parties . many such cases involve allegations that one party has been injured by another party and seeks compensation for the damage that was done . such actions are known as tort or personal injury cases , which are the subject of this chapter . although many personal injury cases involve claims of physical injuries or financial losses , allegations of  psychological injury  or  emotional distress  can also be elements of a tort action . koch , douglas , nicholls , and o ’ neill defined psychological injuries as  stressrelated emotional conditions resulting from real or imagined threats or injuries  caused by a third party . in cases involving claims of emotional distress , psychologists may be retained as experts , most often to evaluate the plaintiff and offer an opinion on the nature and extent of the psychological damage incurred by the plaintiff and the causal relationship between these injuries and the actions of the defendant . this chapter discusses the legal , ethical , and practical aspects of performing forensic psychological evaluations in personal injury cases . legal context of personal injury evaluations . it is important that psychologists undertaking evaluations in personal injury cases have knowledge of the legal parameters of civil litigation . this includes an understanding of tort law , the civil procedure , and the rules governing expert testimony . tort law . tort law forms the legal framework for personal injury cases . a  tort  is a civil wrong , but it is not necessarily an illegal act . sexual assault , for example , is both a crime and a possible basis for a tort action . in contrast , a person who slips on ice outside a neighbor front door and breaks a leg may be able to sue the neighbor for the harm suffered . it is unlikely , however , that the neighbor would be charged for having ice on the doorstep . melton et al . point out that , in addition , torts are not directly related to moral conduct insofar as an act may be immoral but not tortious , and provide the example of a bystander failing to save a drowning child . although this may be morally reprehensible , the person could not be sued for failure to act . in a concise restatement of torts , the american law institute defines tortious conduct as including both acts of commission and acts of omission . for an act to be tortious , it must meet four criteria : duty , dereliction , damage , and causality . duty refers to an obligation by the defendant to the plaintiff . consider a psychologist obligation to keep confidential a patient disclosures . if the psychologist tells someone else what the patient confided , the psychologist would not be living up to this duty . if a psychologist is having coffee with a friend , however , and the friend discloses she is having an affair , the psychologist has no legal duty to keep that information confidential . the second required element is a dereliction or breach . dereliction occurs when the tortfeasor fails to fulfill a duty . for example , the owner of a day care center fails to properly screen potential employees and hires an individual who has a history of sexually abusing children , or a doctor fails to review a patient chart and prescribes a medication to which the patient is allergic . in both of these examples , the duty owed was not fulfilled . damage , which can include monetary losses , physical injuries , or emotional distress , is the third element of a tort . a tort action requires that , in addition to the dereliction of duty , some damage must have occurred . suppose , for example , that when the patient just described attempted to get the prescription filled at the pharmacy , the pharmacist recognized that the patient had an allergy to the medication and called the physician , who then prescribed an alternative medication . despite the physician dereliction of duty , the patient suffered no damage . the patient , therefore , would have no cause for a tort action . the final element of a tort is causality , which requires that the damage incurred be directly related to the tortfeasor dereliction of duty . this concept is also known as proximate cause . the actions of the tortfeasor must be a primary reason or a  substantial factor  in bringing about the harm . in the previous example , suppose that , due to the physician error and the need to obtain an alternative medication , the patient was delayed for an extra thirty minutes at the pharmacy . upon leaving the pharmacy , the patient was struck by a car operated by a drunk driver and suffered severe physical injuries . despite the physician dereliction of duty in prescribing the wrong medication , it is more likely that the actions of the drunk driver and not those of the physician would be considered the proximate cause of the patient injuries . a tort action seeks to make the plaintiff  whole  that is , to return the plaintiff to the state he or she was in prior to the defendant wrongful actions . if the defendant is judged to be responsible for the injury suffered by the plaintiff , the plaintiff will be awarded damages in the form of monetary compensation . the amount of the award is determined by the degree of damage suffered by the plaintiff and the behavior of the defendant that resulted in the plaintiff injury . tortious acts can be intentional or negligent . intent means that the actor desired to cause the consequence of the act . sexual assault is an example of an intentional tort . a woman who sees someone lurking in her yard and points a gun at that person , in order to frighten him so that he will leave her yard , is acting with intent when the person runs away , because inducing fear was the intention of her act . if , however , the person runs into the street in front of a moving car and is killed , his death was not the intent of the actor , despite the ultimate outcome . negligence is defined as  a departure from a standard of conduct demanded by the community for the protection of others against unreasonable risk  . both acts of commission and acts of omission can be negligent . it might be argued that pointing a gun at someone would constitute an unreasonable risk . failing to act can also be negligent . for example , a preschool teacher who failed to notice that a pupil had wandered out of the school might be considered negligent . process of civil litigation . both federal and state courts have rules governing the process of civil litigation . in the federal court system , these rules are known as the federal rules of civil procedure . all states and the district of columbia have similar sets of rules governing civil procedure in their jurisdictions . greenberg noted that , despite variations , most jurisdictions follow a similar pattern , which consists of several stages , including pleadings , discovery , trial , and judgment . at any stage of this process prior to a judgment being rendered , all or part of the case may be dismissed or the parties may agree to a settlement , thus ending the proceedings . the civil action begins when the plaintiff files a legal pleading known as the complaint , which outlines the grounds for the action and the events giving rise to the dispute . the complaint identifies the defendant and describes why the plaintiff believes he or she is entitled to damages . the defendant is then notified of the pending litigation and provides a response , or answer . in addition , the defendant may take other actions , including filing a motion to dismiss , filing a counterclaim whereby the defendant makes a claim against the plaintiff , or filing a notice of an affirmative defense that seeks to negate the plaintiff right to recover . the second phase of personal injury litigation is known as discovery . this phase allows the parties to obtain evidence and can be accomplished in a number of ways , including requests for the production of documents , the use of interrogatories , depositions , and physical or mental examinations of the plaintiff . this is the point at which forensic psychologists typically enter the process . if the plaintiff alleges that he or she incurred psychological damage or suffers from emotional distress as a result of the defendant actions , the defendant has the right to independently assess the nature and degree of psychological damage the plaintiff alleges . this is authorized by frcp rule thirty five . the plaintiff attorney may also choose to have the plaintiff evaluated as a way of providing further evidence supporting the plaintiff claimed injuries or to dispute the findings of the defendant evaluation . the psychologist also provides a written report describing the findings from the examination and the opinions he or she reached . following this disclosure , the psychologist is likely to be  deposed  by the opposing attorney and will be required to provide the opposing attorney with documents , including test data , notes , and correspondence related to the evaluation . the next phase of litigation is the trial . in civil litigation , the plaintiff has the burden of proof . this means the plaintiff is required to prove that it is more likely than not that the defendant actions resulted in damage to the plaintiff . this  standard of proof  is known as preponderance of the evidence . the plaintiff case is presented first . the attorney for the plaintiff will call and directly examine witnesses . in direct examination , the attorney asks nonleading , openended questions , such as  doctor , can you describe your examination of the plaintiff ?  rather than  doctor , isn ’ t it true that the plaintiff has posttraumatic stress disorder ?  the purpose of direct examination is to provide the witness the opportunity to give evidence that will support the plaintiff case . following direct examination of each witness , the defendant attorney will crossexamine the witness . crossexamination is intended to raise questions about the reliability of the witness evidence and/or to expose weaknesses or contradictions in the witness testimony . during crossexamination , leading questions may be asked , such as  doctor , isn ’ t it true that no scale on the minnesota multiphasic personality twonventory–2 can prove that someone is responding truthfully on the test ?  after the plaintiff case is concluded , the defense presents its case . witnesses will be called and directly examined , followed by crossexamination by the plaintiff attorney . after both the plaintiff and the defendant arguments have been presented , the judgment phase begins . the trier of fact will consider the credibility of the evidence and render a verdict . in civil litigation , there are three considerations : did the defendant breach a duty that was owed to the plaintiff ? was the plaintiff injured by the actions of the defendant ? if so , what damages should be awarded to the plaintiff ? either party may choose to appeal the verdict . expert witness in civil litigation . in the federal court system , the meaning of the term expert witness is defined in rule seven hundred and two of the federal rules of evidence as a witness who is  qualified as an expert by knowledge , skill , experience , training , or education  and can assist the trier of fact to  understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue  using  scientific , technical or other specialized knowledge.  expert witnesses , unlike lay witnesses , may testify in the form of opinions and inferences if the testimony is based on sufficient facts and data ; the product of reliable methods and principles ; and if the underlying methods and principles have been applied reliably to the facts of the case . in personal injury cases , a psychologist may be retained as an expert by either the plaintiff or the defendant . the plaintiff can elect to be examined by an expert in order to provide evidence of emotional damage or in an attempt to dispute the findings of the defendant expert . if the findings of the examination do not appear to be helpful to the plaintiff case , it is likely that the plaintiff will not request a written report from the expert or disclose the expert as a potential witness . if the examiner opinion appears to support the plaintiff position , however , he or she will be asked to write a report and will be disclosed as an expert . as noted previously , rule thirty five of the frcp provides that the defendant can force the plaintiff to undergo an examination when the plaintiff claims psychological injury as a basis for receiving damages . in such cases , the plaintiff is entitled to receive a written report describing the examiner findings . this report must be detailed and disclose all the procedures used , the opinions reached , and the foundations for each opinion . in return , the plaintiff is required to provide the defendant any reports under the plaintiff control addressing these same issues . ethical issues in personal injury work . when psychologists are engaged in forensic work , they have increased exposure to legal risks . the parties involved in the legal system have no obligation to safeguard the professional or legal interests of the experts participating in the process . consequently , psychologists may face ethical challenges engendered by the adversarial nature and the differing professional responsibilities , agendas , and goals of those working in the legal system . the ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct contains both aspirational goals and enforceable rules of conduct for psychologists . because the ethical standards are written broadly so as to be applicable to psychologists working in a range of professional roles and circumstances , psychologists doing forensic work may benefit from the additional guidance provided by the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology . unlike the ethical standards of the eppcc , which mandate behavior , the sgfp are  aspirational  and were designed to  improve the quality of forensic psychological services ; enhance the practice and facilitate the systematic development of forensic psychology ; encourage a high level of quality in professional practice ; and encourage forensic practitioners to acknowledge and respect the rights of those they serve  . specific issues that are likely to arise for psychologists performing personal injury evaluations are discussed next . a more detailed discussion of ethical considerations in forensic practice can be found in weiner and hess . in the midst of the adversarial legal system , ethics demand that psychologists remain objective , impartial , and fair . psychologists have a duty to the court to offer  testimony that is reliable , helpful , honest and objective  . this commitment to objectivity must be maintained regardless of which party retained the psychologist , how sympathetic or unsympathetic the plaintiff may be , or the nature of the relationship the psychologist has with the attorneys in the case . one way to facilitate objectivity is for the psychologist to establish consistent evaluation procedures that are utilized regardless of the specific circumstances or retaining party . by following a preestablished protocol , the psychologist is more likely to avoid bias in test selection , the scope or length of the interview , and decisions about including collateral sources . objectivity is also enhanced by a methodical approach to data interpretation characterized by identifying and testing alternative hypotheses , acknowledging and considering inconsistencies in the data , and avoiding selectively attending to data that support the evaluator opinion while ignoring or minimizing conflicting data . roles and role conflict . conducting an evaluation in a personal injury case requires that the psychologist understand his or her role in this process . whether the psychologist is retained by the plaintiff or the defendant , his or her role is to provide an accurate and objective assessment of the plaintiff . this role is distinctly different from the role of a treating psychologist and the role that the attorneys play . as described by greenberg and shuman , the role of the therapist is to demonstrate support , acceptance , and empathy toward the patient and seek to understand the patient perceptions and feelings . the therapist knowledge of the patient world usually is based exclusively on the patient selfreport and is likely to be skewed by the patient biases , assumptions , and attitudes . the therapist is less concerned about the objective truth of the patient circumstances than the patient subjective understanding of these circumstances . because of these differences , psychologists should avoid acting as both treatment provider and objective evaluator for the same individual . this does not preclude a therapist from testifying as a fact witness about the patient treatment , although consideration should be given as to how such testimony might affect the therapeutic relationship . attorneys are required to advocate vigorously for their clients and expect the experts they retain to do the same . the attorney job is to persuade the trier of fact to find in favor of the party the attorney represents . this creates a conflict for the forensic evaluator , who must balance the demands of the advocacybased legal system with psychological ethics that require impartiality and not partisanship . the fact that the attorney is paying the expert and may hold out the promise of future work has the potential to further cloud these issues . the roles a psychologist can play in a personal injury evaluation are not limited to fact witness and expert witness . a psychologist might be retained as a consultant by an attorney . consultants do not evaluate the plaintiff or offer expert testimony . the role of the consultant is to provide expertise to the attorney in preparing and litigating the case . this might include reviewing and commenting on the plaintiff treatment records , assisting with jury selection , reviewing a report summarizing the examination completed by the opposing party expert , reviewing the depositions of the opposing party experts , providing questions for crossexamination of opposing experts , and conducting research . professional ethics demand that psychologists avoid entering into relationships that could compromise their objectivity , competence , or effectiveness . because of this requirement , it is important to consider the potential impact of influences such as the therapeutic bond , financial remuneration , and personal persuasion . psychologists will find it easier to navigate these influences if they avoid multiple roles and remain focused on reaching opinions based on an unbiased and objective view of the evidence . once such opinions are reached , the psychologist can vigorously and persuasively advocate for his or her opinions , keeping in mind the distinction between advocating for an opinion and advocating for a party . as described by kane et al . ,  the expert must resist this pressure , remaining impartial and advocating for his or her opinion , not for his or her retaining attorney  . adequate basis for opinions . psychologists are required to base the opinions in reports and testimony on information and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings . this is consistent with the requirements of the legal system that expert testimony meet certain standards , including that it be based on sufficient facts and data and reliable methods . this means that the evaluator must collect data that are comprehensive , relevant , and valid . in addition , data must be interpreted appropriately . the inferences made must be reasonable and based on the data that were collected . the sgfp stress the importance of utilizing multiple sources of data and attempting to corroborate data by comparing information across sources . in circumstances when such crossvalidation is not possible , resulting limitations should be identified . if the psychologist is not able to obtain sufficient data to reach an opinion on a given question , no opinion should be offered . it is also important to focus on collecting data that are relevant to the legal question at hand . relevant , in this context , is defined as  evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence  . only relevant evidence can be admitted . this distinction requires that the psychologist clearly understand the facts that are at issue and how data can be collected to address those facts specifically . collecting data that are not relevant wastes time and the financial resources of the retaining party . it also serves to confuse the issues and make it more difficult to reach and clearly explicate opinions . preventing misuse of findings . psychologists have an ethical obligation to ensure that their reports and testimony do not contain statements that are untrue or are likely to mislead others . section eleven of the sgfp provides more detailed guidance :  forensic practitioners do not distort or withhold relevant evidence or opinion in reports or testimony . . . . forensic practitioners do not , by either commission or omission , participate in the misrepresentation of their evidence , nor do they participate in partisan attempts to avoid , deny or subvert the presentation of evidence contrary to their own position or opinion  . as noted earlier , attorneys are obligated to vigorously advocate for the parties they represent . as such , attorneys attempt to present evidence in a light most favorable to their clients ’ positions . forensic psychologists must remain alert to attempts to present their findings in ways that may misleading the judge or jury by way of overemphasizing certain points or failing to acknowledge conflicting data . the forensic psychologist must also be sure that the retaining attorney does not misrepresent the psychologist credentials , training , or experience . it is important that the psychologist carefully review the expert disclosure before it is submitted to be sure that it does not misrepresent his or her opinions or overstate the certainty with which those opinions are held . nature of psychological damage . courts have long allowed claims based on physical harm , and all jurisdictions now allow claims of emotional harm proximately related to physical injuries . however , courts have been less receptive to claims based solely on psychological damage absent a physical injury . according to koch , o ’ neill , and douglas , courts have long been skeptical of claims of psychological injury because of fears that , without objective markers for the existence of mental health conditions , such disorders would be easy to fabricate . the ali defines harm in the context of tort law as  the existence of loss or detriment of any kind to a person resulting from any cause  . by extrapolation , this definition suggests that psychological damage has two elements : that there is a change in the plaintiff emotional functioning , and that this change can be attributed , at least in part , to the actions of another party . emotional functioning . it is important to point out that the term psychological damage is not synonymous with psychiatric diagnosis . greenberg , shuman , and meyer differentiated between the clinical issue of assigning a specific diagnostic label and using a diagnostic classification as the basis for a legal determinant :  law does not make diagnosis an essential element of a claim or defense . instead , legal criteria for these actions are functional and concern themselves with impairment or capacity , without regard to diagnosis  . furthermore , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders cautions about its use in nonclinical settings . as described earlier in this chapter , the fit between clinical diagnostic data and legal questions is  imperfect  . in establishing the existence of psychological damage , functional capacity is more relevant than a diagnostic label . grisso defined functional capacity as that which an individual can do or accomplish , as well as the knowledge , understanding , or beliefs that may be necessary for that accomplishment . since functional capacity is distinct from diagnosis , it can not be assumed that the presence of a particular condition is necessarily related to a specific level of functioning . greenberg et al . warned that substituting diagnosis for an analysis of functioning can be misleading , does not serve the purposes of the court , and has the potential to distort an objective assessment of the plaintiff . they noted that tort cases require a functional analysis of the plaintiff in order to understand how , if at all , the defendant actions have affected the plaintiff life . with the understanding that establishing a diagnosis is not required for a claim of psychological injury , there are some conditions that are commonly claimed by plaintiffs in tort cases . witt and weitz reported that the most common symptoms seen following motor vehicle accidents include chronic pain , depression , and anxiety . melton et al . reported that the condition variously known as traumatic neurosis stress, ptsd stress, acute stress disorder is the most commonly observed mental injury in personal injury cases . koch et al . listed ptsd , asd , and major depressive episode as conditions that may be the subject of personal injury litigation . kane et al . pointed to ptsd as the most common diagnosis in personal injury cases . ptsd and asd occupy a unique position in the realm of psychiatric diagnoses , in that these conditions are by definition caused by an external event or circumstance . other conditions , such as depression and panic disorder , can be triggered by a traumatic experience , such as the death of a loved one , but they often arise in the absence of exogenous factors . in terms of personal injury evaluations , forensic experts are more likely to be presented with a diagnosis of ptsd than asd , as the symptoms of asd , according to the diagnostic criteria , resolve within a fourweek period . if the symptoms persist beyond this period , a diagnosis of ptsd would be considered . the type of trauma necessary for a diagnosis of ptsd is clearly outlined in criterion a of the dsm . the trauma must involve experiencing or witnessing an event characterized by actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the integrity of self or others leading to a response of intense fear , helplessness , or horror . consider the following two scenarios : scenario one : while receiving treatment at an inpatient psychiatric facility , a woman was awakened during the night by a male employee who restrained her in her bed while he groped her breasts and genitals . he warned her not to tell anyone , or he would  fix it  so she would have to stay longer in the hospital , and besides ,  no one would take the word of a crazy person.  scenario two : a man who was employed as an executive at a large corporation for a number of years was assigned to report to a new supervisor . he found himself frequently  butting heads  with his new boss , as they had very different approaches and personal styles . after four months , the man was called into his boss office without warning and fired . he was escorted to his office by security , allowed a few minutes to collect his personal belongings , and then escorted out of the building . both of these scenarios describe disturbing events that would be profoundly upsetting to most people . there is , however , a qualitative difference between the circumstances of scenario one and those of scenario two. the events described in the first scenario are consistent with the type of trauma outlined in criterion a , whereas the events described in the second scenario do not meet this criterion , as they do not involve actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the integrity of self . koch et al . recommended considering five questions about a traumatic event : was there a lifethreatening injury as a result of the traumatic event ? was there a physically disabling injury that could conceivably limit employment or accomplishment of important life goals ? did the individual witness a death or severe injury ? was there a realistic fear that the individual life was in danger despite no obvious traumatic injury ? was there some threat to their physical integrity ? if one or more of these questions is answered in the affirmative , it is likely that the event in question would meet the requirements of criterion a. it is important to remember , however , that the fact that an individual has experienced an extreme traumatic stressor does not necessarily mean that the individual will undoubtedly develop ptsd . brunello et al . estimated that onethird of the population will be exposed to a trauma of this magnitude at some point in their lives , yet only ten percent to twenty percent will develop ptsd . ptsd is twice as common among women as among men . the traumas most commonly associated with ptsd are combat exposure among men and rape and sexual molestation among women . in the general population in the united states , the prevalence of ptsd has been estimated at eight percent . in addition to meeting the bar set by criterion a , a diagnosis of ptsd requires the presence of additional symptoms described in criteria b through f. these include persistently reexperiencing the traumatic event , avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma , and experiencing persistent symptoms of increased arousal . as noted by brunello et al . , several of the symptoms of ptsd are not specific to that disorder and overlap with other mental health conditions , including major depressive disorder , anxiety disorders , and substance abuse , which makes diagnosis more complicated . nemeroff et al . suggested that the presence of criterion c symptoms in the months following the trauma was most predictive of the development of ptsd . it should be noted that , even if symptoms of ptsd do appear , they may not persist for months or years . koch et al . noted that , among most representative samples of ptsd sufferers , there is as much as fifty percent spontaneous remission within the first year after experiencing the traumatic event . however , as many as ten percent of those who do develop ptsd remain chronically distressed . the second element in the legal definition of harm is causality the attribution of changes in the plaintiff condition to a specific event . koch et al . noted that it is not necessary to prove that an event in question is the sole cause of the plaintiff psychological injury , but it does have to be a contributing cause . in some cases , existing symptoms might be worsened or exacerbated but not caused by the event . conceptually , determining causality seems simple : compare the plaintiff current functioning with his or her functioning prior to the event . if there is a notable decrement in functional capacity , it must have been caused by the event in question . unfortunately , the practical reality is far from simple . assessing causality is clearly the most difficult task facing the forensic examiner in personal injury work . greenberg , otto , and long pointed out that no psychological test can reliably assess what the plaintiff functioning was like prior to the events in question or separate the effects of one trauma from another . establishing the plaintiff preinjury functioning in the absence of contemporaneously created , extensively detailed , objectively based records is extremely challenging . assessing causality is made more difficult if the plaintiff manifested compromised functioning or experienced other traumatic events prior to the events in question . consider the following example . the plaintiff , a twenty eightyearold woman , was in a car accident in which two people died . she filed a lawsuit alleging , among other things , that she suffered from ptsd as a result of the accident . as a child , the plaintiff was sexually abused by her alcoholic father . by high school , she was frequently skipping classes , developed substance abuse problems , and cut her arms and legs to cope with stress . she dropped out of school and moved in with an older boyfriend who physically assaulted her . she eventually moved out and was working part time in a fast food restaurant at the time of the accident . the woman described in this example has a history of multiple traumas predating the car accident . it is quite possible that her history of abuse led to the development of symptoms of psychological distress . her history also shows evidence of impaired functioning prior to the accident , as evidenced by her difficulty in school and reliance on inadequate coping strategies . despite this history , however , it is also possible that this woman suffered additional psychological damage as a result of the car accident . the difficulty for the examiner would be attempting to sort out which of her current symptoms are attributable to the accident and whether her functioning has been further compromised as a result . consider another scenario : the plaintiff , a thirty sixyearold man , was in a convenience store when an armed robber entered the store and threatened to shoot the clerk unless he gave him cash . the clerk complied and the robber left . the man subsequently filed a lawsuit against the owner of the convenience store , alleging that , as a result of this experience , he had developed panic disorder and depression so severe he was unable to leave his house . as a result , he lost his job as an accountant , a position that he had held for eight years . as a child , the man had been physically abused by his stepfather over a period of ten years . despite this , he had been successful in school , had finished college , and had earned a graduate degree . at the time of the robbery , he owned a home and was engaged . this case is an example of an eggshell plaintiff . despite his history of unimpaired functioning , the man experience of violent abuse at the hands of his stepfather made him especially vulnerable to the stress of the armed robbery . although his reaction was extreme , he may be entitled to compensation from the defendant for all the damage he suffered , even though it is in excess of what the  average  person would have experienced . practical issues . personal injury evaluations involve managing relationships with different parties including the plaintiff , the defendant , and their legal representatives . the nature of the evaluator relationship with each party , including the degree of contact and the flow of communication , varies depending on which party has retained his or her services . it is important for the evaluator to understand how to effectively manage these relationships . dealing with attorneys . in most cases , the forensic examiner is retained by the attorney who represents one of the parties in the litigation . contact usually is initiated by telephone . the attorney typically identifies the party he or she represents , describes the case in general terms , and inquires about the expert experience and knowledge as it relates to the issues involved . the attorney also identifies the other parties and attorney involved in the litigation to determine if the expert has a conflict of interest . the attorney then asks about the expert interest in accepting the referral . the expert should clarify the role he or she is expected to play that is , testifying expert or consultant to ensure that there are no misunderstandings . fees should be discussed in this initial conversation . the expert should request a financial retainer from the attorney along with a letter of agreement outlining the scope of the expert projected involvement and payment arrangements . the expert should request that the retaining attorney provide all available records relating to the case , but the expert should not begin working on the case until the retainer and letter of agreement have been received . it is important to understand that the attorney , not the examinee , is the expert client . as mentioned earlier , if the expert is to examine the plaintiff and offer testimony , the expert commitment is to objectivity and impartiality , not to advocating for the retaining attorney client . dealing with examinees . examinees may present differently depending on whether the examiner was retained by their own attorney or by the opposing attorney . when the examiner is retained by the plaintiff attorney , the plaintiff may approach the examination with the notion that the expert has been hired to  help him out  or to  prove her case.  sometimes plaintiffs assume the examiner will continue to treat them after the initial evaluation . by contrast , when the examiner has been retained by the defense , the plaintiff may be guarded , defensive , or even hostile as a result of assuming the examiner has been hired to attack his or her case . because of this , regardless of by whom the examiner has been hired , it is important for the examiner to help the plaintiff understand that he or she is objective and unbiased . before beginning the examination of the plaintiff , unless the examination has been courtordered , the expert must obtain the plaintiff informed consent . this is true even if the expert has been retained by the plaintiff own attorney . the plaintiff should be informed about the following : the context of the evaluation . if the plaintiff refuses to participate , the examiner should contact the retaining attorney to discuss how to proceed . throughout the examination , the expert needs to walk a fine line in terms of building sufficient rapport to conduct a productive evaluation while remaining clear that the purpose of the meeting is not therapeutic . the examiner can facilitate this process by expressing a desire to understand the plaintiff point of view , by emphasizing the expert role as an independent fact finder , and by treating the plaintiff in a professional and respectful manner . conducting the evaluation . the evaluation of the plaintiff should address the specific questions presented by the retaining attorney . these questions usually include one or more of these : does the plaintiff show evidence of a psychological injury ? sometimes this question will include asking the expert to comment on a specific diagnosis or to formulate a diagnostic impression . if the plaintiff shows symptoms or injuries , are they causally related to the actions of the defendant ? the expert may be asked to specify if the defendant actions were the sole cause , the primary cause , or a contributing cause of the plaintiff injuries . the expert may be asked to identify other events or circumstances that may have contributed to the plaintiff injuries . the expert may also be asked if the plaintiff own actions or inactions contributed to the damage he or she has suffered . how has the plaintiff functioning changed as a result of the claimed injury ? this question usually refers to changes in areas such as work capacity , educational performance , social relationships , family responsibilities , and selfcare . will the plaintiff need treatment ? the expert may be asked to identify the type of treatment and the frequency and duration of the treatment that is being recommended . as discussed earlier in this chapter , accurate opinions can be formulated only when the expert has collected data that are both relevant and sufficient . data collection is especially challenging in a personal injury evaluation , as the expert is expected to form an understanding of the plaintiff past as well as present condition . the use of multiple sources of data is essential in this process . by utilizing a variety of sources , the expert will be able to compare information across sources so as to obtain a more complete and objective understanding of the plaintiff condition and functional capacity . documents and background information . it is recommended that the expert review records prior to meeting with the plaintiff . doing this allows the expert to gain an understanding of the plaintiff and the circumstances leading to the lawsuit . it also allows the expert to identify areas to explore in greater detail when the plaintiff is interviewed . the records involved in any case will vary considerably in volume and nature , depending on the circumstances of the plaintiff , the details of the litigation , and the plaintiff history . typically , available records will fall into one of three categories : medical and mental health treatment records , educational and work records , and legal documents . especially when there is a large volume of records , it is often helpful to begin by organizing the records chronologically and creating a timeline of events , both before and after the claimed injury . doing this provides an overview of the plaintiff situation and will call attention to any gaps in the information that has been provided . written records can be especially useful in trying to understand the plaintiff baseline functioning , particularly when the examiner has access to school transcripts , standardized test scores , or psychological or psychoeducational evaluations that were performed prior to the events in question . treatment records , particularly if they are available both prior and subsequent to the claimed injury , can be valuable in understanding changes in the plaintiff emotional functioning . in reviewing legal documents associated with the case , it is often best to start with the formal complaint . this will lay out , from the plaintiff perspective , the events leading up to the lawsuit , including the nature of the injuries for which the plaintiff is seeking compensation . the plaintiff deposition can be another source of useful information . depositions tend to be quite detailed and cover topics including the plaintiff functioning prior to the alleged injury , the events leading to the alleged injury , and the plaintiff condition subsequent to the alleged injury . depositions of the plaintiff mental health treatment providers can help in understanding the plaintiff condition and progress in treatment . this is especially true if the actual treatment notes are handwritten and difficult to decipher and/or lacking in detail . clinical interview . the purpose of the clinical interview is twofold : to gather information from the plaintiff perspective about his or her history , events surrounding the injury , and events subsequent to the injury ; and to give the expert an opportunity to directly observe the plaintiff appearance , speech , affect , and behavior . sufficient time should be allowed for these purposes . a thorough interview usually takes a minimum of three hours due to the breadth of information that should be covered . given the amount of information to be covered , it is important for the expert to maintain control over the structure of the interview . the examiner should focus on obtaining detailed descriptive information from the plaintiff about his or her functioning before and after the injury rather than asking the plaintiff to provide conclusive statements about his or her condition . for example , rather than asking the plaintiff  do you think you have ptsd ?  the examiner might ask the plaintiff to describe his or her daily life both before and after the events in question . it is useful to start with openended questions and then probe for specific details or examples as necessary . selfreported data can vary in accuracy for a variety of reasons , including the unreliability of memory and limitations in insight . several authors have suggested that the accuracy of selfreported data appears to be influenced by situational factors such as involvement in litigation or compensation seeking . leeshaley et al . and williams , leeshaley , and djanogly reported that , in compensation situations , examinees were more likely to report superior premorbid functioning and poorer current functioning , and they were more likely to exaggerate the number and severity of their symptoms than examinees who were not seeking compensation . as an adjunct to the face-to-face interview and direct observation of the plaintiff , selfreport questionnaires and surveys can be used to record and document the plaintiff reported symptoms , complaints , and functional limitations . selfreport questionnaires should not be confused with psychological tests , in that the former were designed for treatment planning , have high face validity , and lack the means for assessing the validity of the examinee responses . because of these limitations , selfreport questionnaires are useful for collecting information , but they should not be considered objective evidence of valid symptoms . psychological testing . when psychologists are asked to examine a personal injury plaintiff , it is usually assumed that the examination will involve psychological testing . psychological testing can be a valuable source of information that can be used to both formulate and confirm hypotheses as well as to disconfirm hypotheses about psychological constructs relevant to the legal issue . melton et al . described psychological testing as more relevant in personal injury evaluations than in any other forensic context , as many of the constructs measured by psychological tests are directly related to the assessment of distress and impairments in functional abilities . witt and weitz suggested that psychological testing can be useful in three ways : testing may be helpful in identifying the presence of personality disorders . such disorders are , by definition , present from early adulthood . therefore , unless the plaintiff is a child or an adolescent , symptoms of a personality disorder could be assumed to have been present and may have had an influence on the plaintiff functioning and adjustment , prior to the injury that is the subject of the litigation . psychological testing provides a standardized method for assessing the plaintiff current symptoms , by comparing the plaintiff symptom report to the reports of individuals in normal or clinical samples . psychological testing can help in determining if the plaintiff is exaggerating symptoms or otherwise dissimulating , through the use of standalone measures of response style as well as validity scales imbedded in multiscale inventories , such as those found in the twompi2 . despite the potential usefulness of psychological testing , no standard battery has been consistently identified in the literature for use in personal injury evaluations , and greenberg et al . pointed out that not all personal injury examinations require the same assessment instruments . in making decisions about which , if any , psychological tests to use , these authors stressed the importance of using measures that validly assess the constructs they are designed to assess and noted that psychological tests are a method for generating hypotheses rather than for directly answering psycholegal questions . in addition , koch , douglas , nicholls , and o ’ neill cautioned that many of the tests commonly employed in clinical and forensic assessment may not have been evaluated scientifically in an ecologically valid manner for the population being assessed in a personal injury evaluation . several researchers have studied the frequency in which specific psychological tests are used in various forensic contexts . the mmpi was the most frequently named instrument in these surveys . boccaccini and brodsky , for example , found the mmpi was used in eighty nine percent of emotional injury cases by the psychologists who responded to their survey . ultimately , the decision regarding which tests to select for a given evaluation is left to the examiner . a good starting point is to consider the psycholegal questions the evaluation is to address . generally , these questions involve : understanding the plaintiff preevent functioning , understanding the plaintiff current functioning , and determining the credibility of the plaintiff presentation during the evaluation . as pointed out by koch , nader , and haring , although psychological testing can be very useful in evaluating the plaintiff current mental health functioning , there is no scientific support for the use of psychological testing to make definitive statements about an individual functioning at some time in the past . psychological testing may , however , be helpful in gathering information about sustained patterns of functioning that , when used in conjunction with data obtained from collateral sources , can provide some insight into the plaintiff preinjury capacities . in assessing the plaintiff current emotional functioning , multiscale inventories , such as the twompi2 and the personality assessment inventory , are particularly useful as these instruments facilitate an assessment of a broad range of psychopathology . in addition , these tests include sophisticated scales for the detection of exaggerated or other distorted response styles . when selecting instruments to address the plaintiff response style , the nature of the plaintiff reported symptoms should be considered . in addition to the embedded validity scales in instruments like the mmpi and the pai , standalone measures such as the structured interview of reported symptoms , the miller forensic assessment of symptoms test , and the structured inventory of malingered symptomatology can be used . rosen and powel explored the use of a neuropsychological forcedchoice symptom validity test to detect symptom exaggeration in ptsd . they recommended including one of these instruments in forensic evaluations of ptsd if the plaintiff reports problems with memory or concentration . regardless of the methods employed , it is important to remember that no test exists that can  prove  the plaintiff is malingering . wellvalidated measures of symptom overendorsement can provide useful information about the plaintiff approach to the assessment , but they are not sufficient grounds for inferring malingering . collateral data . the use of collateral or thirdparty data is an established principle of forensic mental health assessment . collateral data can help to fill in information that is absent in the plaintiff selfreport , help the expert to form a clearer picture of the plaintiff functioning prior to the injury , and corroborate information obtained from the plaintiff during the interview and from psychological testing . there are many potential sources of collateral data . the specific sources selected will vary depending on the type of information the expert is seeking , the plaintiff situation , and the availability and willingness of sources to provide data . in general , the plaintiff authorization should be sought before contacting or interviewing collateral sources ; however , the plaintiff consent may not be necessary when the examination has been courtordered . collateral data , like other forms of data , are vulnerable to distortion and misinterpretation . heilbrun , warren , and picarello described issues that can limit the accuracy of information obtained from collateral sources . these include reluctance to participate in the evaluation , bias , lack of specific expertise , suggestibility , and memory loss . similar to the approach used when interviewing the plaintiff , interviews with collateral sources should focus on obtaining descriptions of the plaintiff behavior as observed by the collateral source rather than conclusions about the plaintiff condition . this information is best solicited with openended questions about the source observations of the plaintiff followed by probing for specific examples to support the general statements . interpretation of findings . as noted by witt and weitz , personal injury evaluations are challenging because  the evaluator is attempting to retrospectively reconstruct the plaintiff mental condition before , during , and after an event or series of events.  . although an assessment of current psychological functioning is important , the main thrust of the evaluation is on discerning whether a change in adjustment occurred at some time in the past and whether this was caused by some prior event . koch et al . pointed out that , although it is possible to evaluate the plaintiff current emotional functioning and provide descriptive information about his or her past functioning based on information provided by the plaintiff , written records , and collateral sources , there is no scientifically sound method for determining that the plaintiff current condition was definitively caused by a specific event in the past . that said , the expert is often expected to offer some opinions as to the plaintiff current condition and the relationship of this condition to the actions of the defendant . because causality is an  ultimate issue  question , not all courts permit experts to testify about causality . establishing damage . as discussed earlier in this chapter , establishing damage is not synonymous with assigning a diagnostic label . in order to establish damage , three factors must be considered : does the plaintiff manifest symptoms of psychological distress that affect his or her ability to function ? are these symptoms and functional impairments valid ? are these symptoms and functional impairments different from what the plaintiff was experiencing prior to the events leading to the lawsuit ? applying psychology to civil proceedings . in addressing these questions , it is helpful to aggregate information from interviews , records , and testing regarding the plaintiff past and present functioning and to consider each reported symptom and functional impairment separately . for example , if the plaintiff claims that since his accident , he has been too depressed to leave the house most days , the expert can review the plaintiff treatment records , employment records , and information obtained from collateral sources to establish if the impairments the plaintiff is claiming were present prior to the accident . next , the expert can examine test data , collateral information , and current treatment records to determine if these impairments are currently present . the expert should note specific examples and/or test findings that address each symptom and impairment in functioning that the plaintiff reports . doing this allows the expert to corroborate specific pieces of information rather than attempting to confirm or disconfirm a particular diagnosis . if requested by the retaining attorney , once the expert has reviewed these data and has reached some opinions about symptoms and impairments that are currently present , the expert can consider whether the plaintiff symptoms relate to a specific diagnosis . this can be accomplished by reviewing each diagnostic criterion to determine if evidence exists that the plaintiff meets that criterion . as noted earlier in this chapter , damage must be related to a change in the plaintiff functioning , not just the existence of a valid diagnosis . the expert must consider how the plaintiff ability to carry out important functions in his or her daily life has changed as a result of the emotional injury . consideration of functional impairments should always be based on the capacity of the plaintiff prior to the injury . addressing causality . psychological problems are almost always multidetermined . genetic predisposition , early experiences , physiology , social support , substance abuse/exposure , culture , stress , injury , and disease may all play a role to one degree or another . therefore , it is impossible to say with certainty that a particular event was the sole cause of an individual symptoms . in attempting to address issues of causality , four factors can be considered : did the plaintiff symptoms arise subsequent to the events in question ? did the plaintiff experience other traumas that might have contributed to the development of the symptoms ? are other conditions present that could explain , at least in part , the symptoms the plaintiff is experiencing ? has there been a notable change in the plaintiff functional capacity subsequent to the events in question ? by considering this information , the evaluator can begin to formulate opinions about the likelihood that the observed changes in the plaintiff are proximately related to the actions of the defendant . communication of the expert opinion may be accomplished in several different ways . these include the expert disclosure , a written report , a deposition conducted by the opposing party , and testimony at trial . expert disclosure . once the examination is complete and the expert has formed opinions about the plaintiff , the retaining attorney should be contacted by telephone . the examiner should not write a report until this conversation takes place . after speaking to the expert , the attorney may decide that the examiner opinion will not be helpful to his or her case and will not want a report . if the attorney determines that the expert testimony would be useful , the attorney will request a written report . the attorney may also discuss an expert disclosure , which may be submitted prior to the report being completed . although this document will most often be prepared by the attorney , the expert should carefully review the disclosure before it is submitted to ensure that his or her opinion has not been misrepresented or misconstrued . written report . as long as this required information is included , the actual format and organization of the report is left to the expert . a suggested format that includes all the required elements follows . the reader may also wish to consult weiner for a more indepth discussion of forensic report writing . subject of expert opinion . the report should begin with a paragraph identifying the party who retained the expert and a brief statement describing the purpose of the evaluation . summary of expert opinion . a list of the expert opinions that will be presented in the report should follow . qualifications . then the expert should provide one or two paragraphs describing his or her academic and experiential credentials as related to the case . the final sentence should state that a copy of the expert curriculum vitae is attached to the report as an addendum . the cv must contain a listing of the expert publications . data sources . this section should list all the records the expert reviewed , the examination procedures , and any collateral interviews . summary of information obtained from records . this section summarizes the content of the records reviewed by the expert . examination of the plaintiff . this section contains behavioral observations of the plaintiff , summary of the history of the events as reported by the plaintiff , the plaintiff description of his or her injuries and functional impairments , and psychometric test results . expert opinion . this section is a full description and rationale for each opinion listed under the  summary of expert opinion.  each opinion should be supported by examples from the records , interviews , and/or test finding . signature . the report must be signed by the expert . addenda . addenda should include the expert cv , a list of cases in which sworn testimony has been provided in the previous four years , and an invoice or other documentation of the compensation the expert has received from the retaining attorney . sometimes the retaining attorney will ask for a draft report before the final version is sent . it is acceptable for an attorney to point out grammatical or factual errors in a draft report or to suggest that something be explained more fully or clearly . it is not acceptable , however , for the attorney to suggest changes in the examiner opinions . the examiner has a duty to carefully maintain all documentation , notes , and raw data from the evaluation , including information in electronic format , as most of this material is discoverable . some communications between the retaining attorney and the expert may fall under the workproduct exemption from discovery . in the federal court system , discovery is governed by frcp twenty six. the workproduct exemption allows an attorney to protect materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from discovery by the opposing attorney , including material prepared by expert witnesses . it does not protect the examiner opinions , qualifications , prior testimony , compensation received , or data provided to the expert by the attorney all of which are subject to discovery . rule twenty six was amended in two thousand and ten to provide greater protection from discovery . under this revision , draft reports and communications between the attorney and the expert may be exempt from discovery . it is important to remember that each jurisdiction has different rules regarding discovery . ultimately it is up to the judge to determine what is and is not exempt from discovery . because of this fact , the best practice is to assume that everything is discoverable unless told otherwise by the judge . it is very likely that the opposing attorney will want to depose the expert in order to discover additional information about the examiner opinions and the foundation for these opinions . this is also an opportunity for the opposing attorney to size up the expert in order to get a sense of how effectively the expert would testify at a trial . typically the examiner will receive a subpoena commanding appearance for a deposition and to bring everything in the examiner possession relating to the case . a deposition , in which the expert will provide sworn testimony , might last for as little as an hour or as long as several days . the opposing attorney , the retaining attorney , and a court reporter will be present . sometimes the plaintiff attends the deposition as well . the rules of the deposition are explained at the outset . briefly , all answers must be verbal . if a question is not understood , the witness should ask for clarification before answering . the retaining attorney may enter an objection for the record , but the witness is expected to answer the question regardless . it is important for the witness to listen carefully to each question and to answer truthfully and succinctly . occasionally , the opposing attorney may attempt to provoke the witness to see how the witness might react on the stand . if this happens , the best course of action is to remain calm and avoid reacting emotionally . the use of anger or humor is not recommended . at the end of the deposition , the witness is asked if he or she wants to waive signature . the best answer to this question is no , in response to which the deposition transcript will be sent to the witness , who will have an opportunity to correct any errors that were made in recording his or her testimony or errors made by the witness . typically , the expert time spent at the deposition is paid by the attorney conducting the deposition , whereas preparation time usually is paid by the attorney who retained the expert . courtroom testimony . many personal injury cases do not end up going to trial . the parties can agree to a settlement at any time , including during the trial . if the expert is required to testify in court , it is helpful to review the deposition transcript beforehand . if there are any discrepancies between the testimony given at deposition and the expert testimony at trial , the opposing attorney will almost certainly point this out . the examiner report should form the basis for his or her testimony . the retaining attorney will directly examine the examiner using openended questions . in general , it is usually a good idea to review the report with the attorney ahead of time to ensure that the attorney understands the opinions and will ask questions that will facilitate the expert explaining his or her opinion to the judge and jury . applying psychology to civil proceedings . during testimony , the expert should speak clearly and avoid using jargon . ideally , the expert should exude a competent , respectful , professional , yet approachable demeanor . after the direct examination is completed , the opposing attorney will crossexamine the expert . the crossexamination is intended to expose flaws in the expert opinion or to raise questions about the expert credibility . it is important for the expert to listen to all questions carefully before answering . if either attorney objects during direct or crossexamination , the expert should say nothing until the objection has been resolved by the judge . if the objection is sustained , the question must be answered . whether responding to questions under direct or crossexamination , the expert should always keep in mind that his or her primary obligation is to serve the court by giving truthful , unbiased testimony . psychologists must be aware of the limits of their science , especially in terms of extrapolating from the present examination of the plaintiff to inferences about the plaintiff functioning at some time in the past or predictions about his or her future condition . in order to be admissible , the evidence given by the expert witness must be relevant to the legal questions at issue and based on sound science . it is important to not overstate the certainty of one opinions , to acknowledge conflicting data , and to give consideration to alternative hypotheses .

       "'Competency Assessment Instrument. The most important measure developed by McGarry, the Competency Assessment Instrument (CAI), comprises 13 items related to legal issues. It has served as the basis for other subsequently developed forensic assessment instruments. The items include “appraisal of available legal defenses,” “quality of relating to attorney,” and “capacity to disclose pertinent facts.” Each item is scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from “total incapacity” to “no incapacity.” The CAI manual includes clinical examples of levels of incapacity as well as suggested interview questions.  The CAI has been used in a number of jurisdictions, although perhaps more as an interview structuring device rather than the two-stage screening manner (with the CST) as originally intended by McGarry (see Laben et al., 1977; Schreiber, 1978). Unfortunately, few studies report either reliability or validity data. Roesch and Golding (1980) examined the utility of the CAI by comparing 30 interviews conducted by pairs of interviewers who both used the tool; item percentage agreements ranged from 68.8% to 96.7%, with a median of 81.2%. The interviewers were in agreement on the competency status of 29 of the 30 defendants (26 competent, 3 incompetent). The interviewers’ decisions were in concordance with the more lengthy hospital evaluation decisions in 27 of 30 cases, or 90%. In subsequent studies (Golding et al., 1984; others summarized in Nicholson & Kugler, 1991), the CAI has shown high levels of trained inter examiner agreement and examiner-outcome agreement. As such, the CAI may be useful as a screening device or as a full-blown interview measure. Its primary disadvantage, relative to the instruments reviewed next, is in the range of psycholegal abilities articulated and its lack of focus on the nexus between psychopathology and psycholegal impairment.    Interdisciplinary Fitness Interview. The Interdisciplinary Fitness Interview (IFI) is designed to assess both the legal and psychopathological aspects of competency (Golding et al., 1984). The original IFI comprised three major sections: (1) legal issues (5 items), (2) psychopathological issues (11 items), and (3) overall evaluation (4 items). The three items in the consensual judgment section reflect post-assessment resolution of differences between judges.  The IFI has been revised (Golding, 1993) to reflect changes in constitutional law and the adoption by many states of “articulated” competency standards (e.g., Utah Code, 1994). In its current form, the Interdisciplinary Fitness Interview–Revised (IFI-R) taps into 31 relatively specific psycholegal abilities organized across 11 global domains. The IFI-R was developed on the original model used by Golding et al. (1984) but was altered to reflect a decade of experience, numerous court opin-ions, and the accumulated professional literature on competency assessments. For example, it specifically addresses the issue of the iatrogenic effects of psychotropic medications (Riggins v. Nevada, 1992), a defendant’s decisional competency to engage in rational choice about trial strategies, proceeding pro se, or pleading guilty (see earlier discussion of Godinez v. Moran, 1993) and competency to confess. It was developed to mirror Utah’s (1994) articulated competency code, which mandates'"

       "'assessing competency to stand trial . competency to stand trial is a concept of jurisprudence allowing the postponement of criminal proceedings for those defendants who are unable to participate in their defense on account of mental disease or intellectual disability . because trial competency issues are raised substantially more often than the insanity defense , psychologists involved in forensic assessment and consultation are likely to have more experience with competency evaluations than those of criminal responsibility . estimates are that approximately sixty competency evaluations are conducted in the united states annually . this number has increased substantially from estimates in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety seven that placed the annual number of competency evaluations between twenty five and thirty nine . in this chapter , we present an overview of competency laws , research , and methods of assessment , with the aim of providing forensic psychologists with the basic information necessary to conduct competency evaluations . we do not believe , however , that this chapter will sufficiently prepare a novice forensic psychologist to carry out such evaluations . the issues surrounding competency determinations are highly complex ; therefore , an evaluator needs not only a high level of clinical knowledge and skill but also a sophisticated knowledge of the legal system . we urge readers interested in pursuing work in the competency arena to supplement this chapter with additional sources as well as workshops and other forms of continuing education . the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology also contain discussions relevant to competency evaluations . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . defining competency . provisions allowing for a delay of trial because a defendant was incompetent to proceed have long been a part of the judicial system due process standards . english common law allowed for an arraignment , trial , judgment , or execution of an alleged capital offender to be stayed if he or she  be absolutely mad  . over time , statutes that have been created in the united states and canada have further defined and extended the common law practice . the modern standard in the united states was established in dusky v. united states . although the wording differs across jurisdictions , all states use a variant of the dusky standard to define competency . in dusky , the supreme court held : it is not enough for the district judge to find that  the defendant is oriented to time and place and has some recollection of events ,  but that the test must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him . while the concept of competency to stand trial has been long established in law , ambiguities in the wording of dusky raise a number of questions . what is meant by  sufficient present ability  ? how does one determine whether a defendant  has a rational as well as factual understanding  ? to be sure , some courts and legislatures have provided some direction to evaluators in the form of articulated dusky standards , but the forensic evaluator is left largely unguided except by a common principle , that evaluators can not reach a finding of incompetency independent of the facts of the legal case . the problem in defining and assessing competency leads to a broad range of interpretations of the dusky standard . because the courts and legislatures have given mental health professionals a large share of the responsibility for defining and evaluating competency , it should not be surprising to find that mental status issues , such as presence or absence of psychosis , traditionally have played a dominant role in the findings of evaluators . historically , in fact , evaluators initially equated psychosis with incompetency . furthermore , evaluators in the past rarely took into account the specific demands of a defendant case . practice standards are more clearly delineated at present , and , as a result , practice in this area continues to improve . in the past , evaluators typically were employed in state psychiatric hospital settings and were not formally trained in the assessment of competency or in matters of the law . as a consequence , the evaluations were based on the same standard mental status examinations that had been used with other patients in the hospital . psychological tests were rarely used ; if they were employed , they were utilized as a diagnostic tool to determine the presence or absence of psychosis . over the past thirty five years , these practices have been challenged and improved based on empirical research findings . for example , research has provided evidence that the presence of psychosis was not sufficient by itself for a finding of incompetency , and modern empirical studies of competency reports have demonstrated that evaluators rarely make that simple conceptual error . nevertheless , although forensic evaluators today typically have more training than those in the past , most states still do not require specific training of mental health professionals who conduct such evaluations . the specific psycholegal abilities required of a defendant are the most important aspect of assessing fitness . the contextual nature of competence has been explored . some researchers and scholars have argued that competence should be considered within the context in which it is to be used . for instance , the abilities required by the defendant in his or her specific case should be taken into account when assessing competence . this contextual perspective was summarized by golding and roesch : mere presence of severe disturbance is only a threshold issue it must be further demonstrated that such severe disturbance in this defendant , facing these charges , in light of existing evidence , anticipating the substantial effort of a particular attorney with a relationship of known characteristics , results in the defendant being unable to rationally assist the attorney or to comprehend the nature of the proceedings and their likely outcome . the importance of a contextual determination of specific psycholegal abilities has been repeatedly demonstrated by empirical findings that abilities in one area of functioning are rarely homogenous with those in other areas of functioning . supreme court decisions in both the united states and canada , however , have confused this issue by finding that the standard by which competency to be judged is not contextspecific . in regina v. whittle , the supreme court of canada ruled that there is to be only one standard for competency regardless of the specific abilities to be performed by the accused . that court concluded that there is no difference between the essential abilities needed in making active choices about waiving counsel , making decisions at trial , confessing , or pleading guilty . it ruled that different standards of competency should not be applied for different aspects of criminal proceedings and that the test to be used is one of  limited cognitive capacity  in each of these circumstances . however , unlike in godinez v. moran , the forensic examiners had actually evaluated mr. whittle in these specific contexts , regardless of whether the standard to be applied was the same or different as a function of the context . in godinez v. moran , the united states supreme court held similarly that the standard for the various types of competency should be considered the same . justice thomas wrote for the majority : the standard adopted by the ninth circuit is whether a defendant who seeks to plead guilty or waive counsel has the capacity for  reasoned choice  among the alternatives available to him . how this standard is different from the dusky standard whether the defendant has a  rational understanding  of the proceedings is not readily apparent to us . . . . while the decision to plead guilty is undeniably a profound one , it is no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial . . . . nor do we think that a defendant who waives his right to the assistance of counsel must be more competent than the defendant who does not , since there is no reason to believe that the decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional rights . in his dissent , justice blackmun noted that the  majority analysis is contrary to both common sense and longstanding case law  and reasoned that competency can not be considered in a vacuum , separate from its specific legal context . justice blackmun argued that  competency for one purpose does not necessarily translate to competency for another purpose  and noted that previous supreme court cases  required competency evaluations to be specifically tailored to the context and purpose of a proceeding  . what is missing from the majority opinion in godinez , however , is that , unlike the circumstances in whittle , moran competency to waive counsel or plead guilty to death penalty murder charges was never assessed by the forensic examiners , regardless of which standard was employed . the godinez holding has been subsequently criticized by legal scholars and courts alike . in the words of the third circuit court of appeals ,  this difficult case presents us with a window through which to view the realworld effects of the supreme court decision in godinez v. moran , and it is not a pretty sight  . the problem is not whether the standards for various psycholegal competencies are higher , different , or the same , but rather , more fundamentally , whether the defendant has been examined with respect to these issues in the first place . a single standard for competency to stand trial was a basis for finding colin ferguson , a man accused of murdering six people and injuring nineteen others on the long island rail road in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety three , competent to waive counsel and represent himself . his lawyers intended to raise the insanity defense , but ferguson objected and requested that he represent himself . since he had been found competent to stand trial , the trial court allowed him to represent himself , or proceed pro se . the bizarre nature of the trial , in which ferguson crossexamined the police who arrested him as well as some victims , led perlin to comment that the proceedings were a charade , and he concluded that the godinez decision resulted in a trial in which dignity , a prerequisite of a fair trial , was not preserved . subsequently , the united states supreme court , in indiana v. edwards , addressed the issue of whether there should be a different standard for competence to stand trial and competence to represent oneself . ahmad edwards , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia , attempted to steal a pair of shoes from a department store in indiana , and , when security officers tried to apprehend him , he opened fire . he was subsequently charged with attempted murder , battery with a deadly weapon , criminal recklessness , and theft . in two thousand , he was found incompetent to stand trial and remanded for treatment . he was restored to competency after seven months ; however , his attorneys requested a second evaluation in two thousand and two , whereby he was found competent . in two thousand and three , his attorneys requested a third evaluation , which resulted in a finding of incompetence . his competence was restored once again and he proceeded with adjudication . in two thousand and five , when his trial was set to begin , edwards asked to proceed pro se . the trial judge denied the request . edwards proceeded with appointed counsel and ultimately was convicted of the attempted murder and battery charges . the case carried through the appeals process and eventually was heard by the united states supreme court , which held that the constitution does not prevent states from requiring counsel for those found competent to stand trial but who are not deemed competent to proceed pro se . the court addressed its earlier decision in godinez in the ruling but indicated that it did not provide direction in this case because the defendant ability to conduct a defense at trial was not an issue at hand in godinez and because the holding allows a state to permit a questionably competent defendant to proceed pro se , but it did not indicate whether a state may deny such a defendant . standards of competence are one area of inquiry , whereas the conceptualization of competence is another . some researchers and scholars have provided reconceptualizations of competence to stand trial . winick cogently argued that , in some circumstances , it might be in the best interests of the defendant to proceed with a trial even if he or she is incompetent . he postulated that this could take the form of a provisional trial wherein the support of the defense attorney would serve to ensure protection of the defendant . this would allow the defendant to proceed with his or her case while maintaining decorum in the courtroom and respecting the defendant constitutional rights . bonnie also set forth a reformulation of competence to stand trial . he proposed a distinction between two types of competencies : competence to assist counsel and decisional competence . he argued that defendants found incompetent to assist counsel should be barred from proceeding until they were restored to competence , whereas defendants found decisionally incompetent could proceed in certain cases in which their lawyers were able to present a defense . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . another major change has been the shift in the type of settings in which competency assessments are conducted . roesch and golding argued that inpatient evaluations are unnecessary in all but perhaps a small percentage of cases , because most determinations of competency can easily be made on the basis of brief screening interviews . communitybased settings , including jails and mental health centers , are increasingly used to conduct evaluations . in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four , grisso , coccozza , steadman , fisher , and greer published the results of a national survey they had conducted to determine the organization of pretrial forensic evaluation services in the united states . they concluded that  the traditional use of centrally located , inpatient facilities for obtaining pretrial evaluations survives in only a minority of states , having been replaced by other models that employ various types of outpatient approaches  . one compelling reason for this shift is cost . in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy seven , laben , kashgarian , nessa , and spencer estimated that the cost of the communitybased evaluations they conducted in tennessee was onethird of the cost of institutionbased evaluations . in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty five , winick estimated that $ one hundred and eighty five million was spent annually on competency evaluations ; however , more recent estimates are two or three times higher and probably reach $ one billion if the costs associated with the entire competency evaluation and treatment process are considered . for instance , in two thousand , bonnie and grisso estimated that approximately sixty competency evaluations were performed each year . blending communityand institutionbased evaluations , a typical evaluation cost is $ five per defendant ; thus , approximately $ three hundred million may be spent annually on competency evaluations . if twenty percent of examined defendants are adjudicated incompetent , there are twelve restoration commitments yearly . in a typical jurisdiction , the average cost of a year in a forensic institution is $ one hundred and forty five ; thus , a conservative estimate of restoration costs per defendant would be $ thirty six for a threemonth period , bringing the annual restoration total to approximately $ four hundred and thirty five million . therefore , it appears that a conservative estimate of evaluation and restoration costs in the united states is upward of $ seven hundred million annually . widespread use of screening instruments would serve to lower these costs , because the majority of individuals for whom competence is clearly not an issue would be screened out . only those defendants whom the screening instrument has identified as potentially incompetent would then be referred for a more indepth assessment . screening instruments can be administered in communitybased settings as well as in local jails or courthouses , thereby also serving to eliminate the unnecessary detention of clearly competent individuals . base rates for competency referrals and for incompetency determinations vary widely across jurisdictions and evaluation settings . this occurs for a number of reasons , including variations in examiner training and the use of forensically relevant evaluation procedures ; differences in the application of standards by examiners ; the availability of pretrial mental health services ; the nature of the referral system ; inadequate treatment services for the chronically mentally ill and criminalization of their conduct ; and the extent to which judges scrutinize bona fide doubt about a defendant competency before granting evaluation petitions . nevertheless , a metaanalysis of sixty eight studies reported a base rate of incompetence of twenty seven percent . precise data are not available , but conservatively , half of those found competent presented little or no reason for doubting their competency and could have been detected by adequate screening procedures . this is true in the united states as well as in other countries . zapf and roesch investigated the rate of incompetence in individuals remanded to an inpatient setting for an assessment of fitness to stand trial in canada . their results indicated that only eleven percent of the remands were unfit to stand trial and , further , that with the use of a brief screening interview , eighty two percent of the remands could have been screened out at some earlier time because they were clearly fit to stand trial . many of the assessment procedures we describe later in this chapter are either explicitly designed for screening or could easily be adapted for use in such settings . a number of instruments designed to assess competence have been developed over the past fifty years . this work was pioneered by mcgarry and his colleagues and served as the starting point for a more sophisticated and systematic approach to the assessment of competency . in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty six , grisso coined the term forensic assessment instrument to describe instruments that provide the framework for conducting forensic assessments . fais are measures designed to evaluate psycholegal abilities rather than the psychological constructs measured by traditional psychological tests . fais make forensic assessments more systematic and assist evaluators in collecting important and relevant information by following the decisionmaking process required under the law . since the term was coined , a number of assessment instruments have been developed that are designed to work in this way , and it appears that the use of fais has been increasing . this trend is encouraging in that empirical data suggest that trained examiners using fais achieve the highest levels of interexaminer and examineradjudication agreement . before turning to a review of specific assessment methods , we provide a brief overview of the legal procedures involved in competencybased questions . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . laws regarding competency vary from state to state , although most jurisdictions follow procedures similar to the overview we describe in this section . clinicians should consult the statute for the specific law and procedures applicable in their state . the issue of competency may be raised at any point in the adjudication process . if a court determines that a bona fide doubt exists as to a defendant competency , it must consider this issue formally , usually via a forensic evaluation , which can take place , as noted , while the defendant is in the community , in jail , or in another institutional setting . one legal issue that may concern evaluators is whether information obtained in a competency evaluation can be used against a defendant during the guilt phase of a trial or at sentencing . although concerns regarding selfincrimination have been raised , all jurisdictions in the united states and canada provide , either statutorily or through case law , that information obtained in a competency evaluation can not be used in the context of a defendant guilt unless the defendant places his or her mental state into evidence at either the trial or the sentencing hearings . once a competency evaluation has been completed and the written report has been submitted , the court may schedule a hearing . if both defense and prosecution accept the findings and recommendations in the report , however , a hearing does not have to take place . as such , it is likely that , in the majority of cases , a formal hearing is not held . if a hearing is held , the evaluators may be asked to testify , but most hearings are quite brief , and usually only the written report of an evaluator is used . the ultimate decision about competency rests with the court , which is not bound by the evaluators ’ recommendations . in most cases , however , the court accepts the recommendations of the evaluators . at this point , defendants adjudicated competent proceed with their cases . for defendants found incompetent , their trials are postponed until their competency is regained or the charges are dismissed , usually without prejudice . the disposition of incompetent defendants is perhaps the most problematic aspect of this area of law . until the case of jackson v. indiana , virtually all states allowed for the automatic and indefinite commitment of incompetent defendants . in jackson , however , the united states supreme court held that defendants committed solely on the basis of incompetency  can not be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future  . the court did not specify how long a period of time would be reasonable , nor did it indicate how progress toward the goal of regaining competency could be assessed . the jackson decision led to revisions in state statutes that provided alternatives to commitment and limited the length of commitment . the duration of confinement varies from state to state ; some states have specific time limits while others are based on a proportion of the length of sentence that would have been given if the defendant were convicted . medication is the most common form of treatment provided to restore defendants ’ competence , although some jurisdictions have established psychoeducational programs designed to increase defendants ’ understanding of the legal process or to confront problems that hinder a defendant ability to participate in the defense . what happens if an incompetent defendant refuses treatment , particularly medications ? the united states supreme court case provided at least a partial answer to this question . in sell v. united states , the supreme court considered the case of charles sell , a dentist who was charged with multiple counts of insurance fraud and who was deemed incompetent and committed for treatment at a federal medical center . sell refused medication , and the treatment staff subsequently sought to have him involuntarily medicated . the medical center review panels concluded that sell was mentally ill and dangerous , that medication would be helpful in reducing his symptoms , and that medication would also help restore his competence to stand trial . sell appealed , and the federal magistrate who had ordered sell commitment supported the government position that medication was the best treatment alternative to address the issue of his dangerousness and also to restore his competency . the supreme court held that antipsychotic drugs could be administered against a defendant will for the purpose of restoring competency , but only in limited circumstances . the court noted that this applied only to the issue of competency restoration , and indicated that medication could be justified on other grounds , including dangerousness . writing for the majority , justice breyer identified several factors that must be satisfied before a defendant can be involuntarily medicated . these include a determination that the medication is likely to restore competence but will not result in side effects that might affect a defendant ability to assist counsel . the court must also find that alternative and less intrusive methods that would achieve the same result are not available . the sell decision may have limited the use of medication as an option for some incompetent defendants who refuse voluntary treatment . indeed , justice breyer commented that he thought that instances of forced medication might be rare . as a consequence , the sell case may result in a greater emphasis being placed on the development of alternative forms of treatment for restoring competence . nevertheless , cochrane and his colleagues conducted a retrospective records review of all incompetent defendants who were involuntarily treated under sell in the united states federal court system between two thousand and three and two thousand and nine. they found that seventy nine percent of those diagnosed with a psychotic disorder responded well to treatment and ultimately were deemed competent to stand trial . this brief overview of competency procedures is intended to provide a basic understanding of the process . for a more comprehensive discussion of the legal issues involved and a review of empirical research on the various aspects of the competency procedures , the reader is referred to reviews by pirelli , gottdiener , and zapf and by zapf and roesch . assessing competency . although there has been some confusion over the definition of the term competency , there is generally a high level of agreement among evaluators regarding a defendant competence . researchers who have investigated interrater reliability generally report that pairs of evaluators agree in up to eighty percent or more of the cases . gowensmith , murrie , and boccaccini published findings from a study conducted with a sample of two hundred and sixteen hawaiian cases and found slightly lower agreement rates ; they found seventy one percent agreement among examiners in initial competency evaluations and sixty one percent agreement in cases pertaining to competency restoration . murrie and colleagues found great variability in levels of agreement , which they attributed to evaluator , system , and policylevel factors . when evaluators are highly trained and use semistructured competence assessment instruments , however , high rates of agreement have been reported . when base rates of findings of competency are considered , these high levels of agreement are less impressive , and they do not suggest that evaluators are necessarily in agreement about the specific criteria involved in a determination of competency . in their recently published metaanalysis , pirelli , gottdiener , and zapf found the base rate of incompetency to be twenty seven percent in a total sample of over twenty pretrial defendants referred for such evaluations . thus , examiners , without even directly assessing a group of defendants , could achieve high levels of agreement with an examining clinician simply by deeming all defendants competent . because in most jurisdictions more than seventy percent of all referred defendants are adjudicated competent , the psychologist and the examiner would achieve at least modest agreement , even without making any further decisions . skeem and her colleagues demonstrated that examiner agreement on specific psycholegal deficits averaged only twenty five percent across a series of competency domains . it is the more difficult decisions , involving cases where competency is truly a serious question , that are of greatest concern . how reliable are decisions about these cases ? one study used a vignette methodology to determine whether examiners would distinguish between three different standards for competency . results of this study indicated that examiners were almost equally divided in their opinions regarding the defendant competence when applying dusky rational understanding standard : forty seven percent found the defendant competent and fifty two percent found the defendant incompetent . similar results were found for the rational manner standard and the standard that did not use the word rational . these authors felt that the nearly equally divided response to the same vignette was shocking and concluded that  the defendant fate depends only on who performs the evaluation  . high levels of reliability do not , of course , ensure that valid decisions are being made . two evaluators could agree that the presence of psychosis automatically leads to a finding of incompetency . as long as the evaluators are in agreement about their criteria for determining psychosis , the reliability of their final judgments about competency would be high . as we suggest throughout this chapter , it is quite possible that too many evaluators inappropriately rely on traditional mental status issues without considering the functional aspects of a particular defendant case . the validity of competency judgments is difficult to assess because of the criterion problem . criterionrelated validity typically is assessed by examining concurrent validity and predictive validity . predictive validity is impossible to assess fully in the competency arena , because only defendants who are considered competent are allowed to proceed . it is feasible to look at the predictive validity of decisions about competent defendants , but it is not possible to assess the decisions about incompetent defendants , because they are remanded for treatment and their judicial proceedings are suspended . concurrent validity is also difficult to investigate , because it is not useful to examine correlations with other measures if one adopts a functional , case-by-case assessment of a defendant competency . for these reasons , there is no  correct  decision against which to compare judgments . as we have indicated , the courts usually accept mental health professionals ’ judgments about competency . does this mean that the judgments are valid ? not necessarily , because courts often accept the evaluator definition of competency and his or her conclusions without review , leading to very high levels of examiner–judge agreement an issue that has been acknowledged for quite some time . roesch and golding argued that the only ultimate way of assessing the validity of decisions about incompetency is to allow defendants who are believed to be incompetent to proceed with a trial anyway . this could be a provisional trial in which assessment of a defendant competencerelated abilities could continue . if a defendant were unable to participate , then the trial could be stopped . if a verdict had already been reached and the defendant was convicted , the verdict could be set aside . we suspect that , in a significant percentage of trials , alleged incompetent defendants would be able to participate . in addition to the obvious advantages to defendants , the use of a provisional trial could provide valuable information about what should be expected of a defendant in certain judicial proceedings . short of a provisional trial , it may be possible to address the validity issue by having independent experts evaluate the information provided by evaluators and other collateral information sources . functional evaluation approach . we believe the most reasonable approach to the assessment of competency is based on a functional evaluation of a defendant ability matched to the contextualized demands of the case . although an assessment of the mental status of a defendant is important , it is not sufficient as a method of evaluating competency . rather , the mental status information must be related to the specific demands of the legal case , as has been suggested by legal decisions , such as the ones involving amnesia . as in the case of psychosis , a defendant with amnesia is not per se incompetent to stand trial , as has been held in a number of cases . in missouri v. davis , the defendant had memory problems due to brain damage . nevertheless , the missouri supreme court held that amnesia alone was not a sufficient reason to bar the trial of an otherwise competent defendant . in montana v. austad , the court held that the bulk of the evidence against the defendant was physical and not affected by amnesia . finally , in a maryland decision , the court held that , because of the potential for fraud , amnesia does not justify a finding of incompetence . the court also stated that everyone has amnesia to some degree , because the passage of time erodes memory . these decisions are of interest because they support the view that evaluators can not reach a finding of incompetency independent of the facts of the legal case . similarly , a defendant may be psychotic and still be found competent to stand trial if the symptoms do not impair the defendant functional ability to consult with his or her attorney and otherwise rationally participate in the legal process . some cases are more complex than others and may , as a result , require different types of psycholegal abilities . thus , it may be that the same defendant is competent for one type of legal proceeding but not for another . in certain cases , a defendant may be required to testify . in this instance , a defendant who is likely to withdraw in a catatoniclike state may be incompetent to proceed ; however , the same defendant may be able to proceed if the attorney intends to enter a plea bargain . the functional approach is illustrated in the famous amnesia case of wilson v. united states . in that decision , the court of appeals held that six factors should be considered in determining whether a defendant amnesia impaired the ability to stand trial : the extent to which the amnesia affected the defendant ability to consult with and assist his lawyer . the extent to which the amnesia affected the defendant ability to testify in his own behalf . the extent to which the evidence in suit could be extrinsically reconstructed in view of the defendant amnesia . such evidence would include evidence relating to the crime itself as well as any reasonable possible alibi . the extent to which the government assisted the defendant and his counsel in that reconstruction . the strength of the prosecution case . most important here will be whether the government case is such as to negate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence . if there is any substantial possibility that the accused could , but for his amnesia , establish an alibi or other defense , it should be presumed that he would have been able to do so . any other facts and circumstances which would indicate whether or not the defendant had a fair trial . one could substitute any symptom for amnesia in the quote from wilson . if this were done , the evaluation of competency certainly would be one based on a determination of the manner in which a defendant incapacity may affect the legal proceedings . in fact , some state codes , such as florida , see winick , one thousand, nine hundred and eighty three ) and utah code , already specify that the evaluators must relate a defendant mental condition to clearly defined legal factors , such as the defendant appreciation of the charges , the range and nature of possible penalties , and capacity to disclose to an attorney the pertinent facts surrounding the alleged offense . utah statute goes the farthest in this regard , specifying the most comprehensive range of psycholegal abilities to be addressed by evaluators and also requiring judges to specify which psycholegal abilities are impaired when a defendant is found incompetent . the assessment of competency requires consideration of both mental status and psycholegal abilities . unfortunately , research findings have demonstrated that evaluators often do not address an appropriate range of psycholegal abilities and most often do not draw a connection between the defendant emotional or behavioral impairments and impaired psycholegal capacities . we now turn to a review of the history of competency assessment methods . competency assessment tools . prior to the nineteen sixties , there were no standard methods for assessing competency . one of the first was a checklist developed by robey that focused on court processrelated issues , such as understanding of the legal process . another early procedure , developed by bukatman , foy , and de grazia , used a checklist and a set of interview questions . neither of these early measures was used often . undoubtedly , a. louis mcgarry and his colleagues at the harvard medical school laboratory of community psychiatry had the greatest early influence on the formal assessment of competency . mcgarry , a psychiatrist , was involved in the development of two measures : the competency screening test and the competency assessment instrument . we next discuss these measures in addition to a number of other measures that have since been developed . competency screening test . the competency screening test was created by lipsitt et al . as a screening measure to identify clearly competent defendants and minimize the need for lengthy institutional evaluations . such a screening process was considered important because the vast majority of defendants referred for evaluations are competent . the high rate of competency is that many other factors influence referrals , including the use of the evaluation commitment as a method for denying bail , as a tactical maneuver to delay a trial , as a way of providing a basis for a reduction in charges or sentences , and as a means of getting defendants who are seen as in need of mental health treatment out of jails and into hospitals . mumley , tillbrook , and grisso referred to this as the  subversion  hypothesis ; that is , using competency evaluations in a backdoor manner to provide defendants with treatment . the cst , however , has seldom been used as a screening device because of various validityrelated concerns . specifically , the tool focuses on defendants ’ knowledge of legal issues to the exclusion of other factors , and its scoring method has been criticized because of its idealized perception of the criminal justice system ; certain responses actually may reflect a sense of powerlessness in controlling one outcome in the legal system and may be based on past experiences with that system . the cst has been examined in a number of studies . although it has high levels of interrater reliability in terms of scoring the incomplete sentence format , studies comparing classifications based on cst cutoff scores and hospital evaluation decisions reveal that it has a high falsepositive rate . the results of these studies lead to a mixed review of the cst . although it appears that the cst is reliably scored , serious questions can be raised about its usefulness as a screening device , because of the potential for misclassifying potentially competent defendants . at this point , it is not recommended for use as the sole method of screening defendants . competency assessment instrument . the most important measure developed by mcgarry , the competency assessment instrument , comprises thirteen items related to legal issues . it has served as the basis for other subsequently developed forensic assessment instruments . the items include  appraisal of available legal defenses ,   quality of relating to attorney ,  and  capacity to disclose pertinent facts.  each item is scored on a fivepoint scale , ranging from  total incapacity  to  no incapacity.  the cai manual includes clinical examples of levels of incapacity as well as suggested interview questions . the cai has been used in a number of jurisdictions , although perhaps more as an interview structuring device rather than the twostage screening manner as originally intended by mcgarry . unfortunately , few studies report either reliability or validity data . roesch and golding examined the utility of the cai by comparing thirty interviews conducted by pairs of interviewers who both used the tool ; item percentage agreements ranged from sixty eight percent to ninety six percent , with a median of eighty one percent . the interviewers were in agreement on the competency status of twenty nine of the thirty defendants . the interviewers ’ decisions were in concordance with the more lengthy hospital evaluation decisions in twenty seven of thirty cases , or ninety percent . in subsequent studies , the cai has shown high levels of trained inter examiner agreement and examineroutcome agreement . as such , the cai may be useful as a screening device or as a fullblown interview measure . its primary disadvantage , relative to the instruments reviewed next , is in the range of psycholegal abilities articulated and its lack of focus on the nexus between psychopathology and psycholegal impairment . interdisciplinary fitness interview . the interdisciplinary fitness interview is designed to assess both the legal and psychopathological aspects of competency . the original ifi comprised three major sections : legal issues , psychopathological issues , and overall evaluation . the three items in the consensual judgment section reflect postassessment resolution of differences between judges . the ifi has been revised to reflect changes in constitutional law and the adoption by many states of  articulated  competency standards . in its current form , the interdisciplinary fitness interview–revised taps into thirty one relatively specific psycholegal abilities organized across eleven global domains . the ifir was developed on the original model used by golding et al . but was altered to reflect a decade of experience , numerous court opinions , and the accumulated professional literature on competency assessments . for example , it specifically addresses the issue of the iatrogenic effects of psychotropic medications , a defendant decisional competency to engage in rational choice about trial strategies , proceeding pro se , or pleading guilty and competency to confess . it was developed to mirror utah articulated competency code , which mandates that examiners address its eleven global domains . a revised and comprehensive training manual is available . golding et al . used the ifi in a study of pretrial defendants in the boston area who were referred by court clinics to a state mental hospital for competency evaluation . teams composed of a lawyer and either a psychologist or a social worker interviewed defendants . although the interviews were conducted jointly , each evaluator independently completed the ifi rating form . the results demonstrated that lawyers and mental health evaluators could make reliable competency judgments together . they were in agreement on ninety seven percent of their final determinations of competency . by type of decision , the interviewers found fifty eight defendants to be competent and seventeen incompetent , and they disagreed on only two cases . fitness interview test . the fitness interview test was created in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty four to structure fitness to stand trial assessments conducted in canada . it has since been extensively revised , and the current version is referred to as the fitness interview test . the fitr focuses on the psycholegal abilities of the individual . the scoring system has been changed to a threepoint scale , with a score of two meaning definite or serious impairment , one meaning possible or mild impairment , and zero meaning no impairment . the items on the fitr were developed to parallel the standards for fitness that were established in section two of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety two revision of the criminal code of canada , which are quite similar to the standards articulated by the united states supreme court in dusky v. united states . the fitr takes approximately thirty minutes to administer and consists of a structured interview that addresses three main areas : ability to understand the nature or object of the proceedings , or factual knowledge of criminal procedure ; ability to understand the possible consequences of the proceedings , or the appreciation of personal involvement in and importance of the proceedings ; and ability to communicate with counsel or to participate in the defense . each of these three sections is broken down into specific questions that tap into different areas involved in fitness to stand trial . the first section assesses the defendant understanding of the arrest process ; the nature and severity of current charges ; and the role of key players , legal processes , pleas , and court procedure . the second section assesses the defendant appreciation of the range and nature of possible penalties , appraisal of available legal defenses , and appraisal of likely outcomes . the final section assesses the defendant capacity to communicate facts to the lawyer , relate to the lawyer , plan legal strategy , engage in his or her own defense , challenge prosecution witnesses , testify relevantly , and manage courtroom behavior . the fitr has demonstrated excellent utility as a screening instrument in research studies . zapf and roesch compared the results of the fitr and an institutionbased fitness assessment for fifty seven defendants remanded to an inpatient psychiatric institution for an evaluation of fitness . when specific decision rules were used to classify defendants as either fit or unfit , the fitr correctly predicted fitness status for forty nine of the fifty seven individuals . the remaining eight individuals were judged to be unfit by the fitr and fit as a result of the inpatient assessment . these falsepositive errors were expected , as screening instruments should overestimate the rate of unfitness without making any falsenegative errors . there was one hundred percent agreement between the fitr and the institutionbased assessment for those individuals deemed fit to stand trial . research also has indicated that the fitr has adequate psychometric properties . viljoen , roesch , and zapf found that the average interrater reliability of the fitr for overall determination of fitness was ninety eight8. reliability for the sections was lower and ranged from fifty four4 to seventy0 for groups of raters . to investigate the predictive validity of the fitr , zapf et al . compared decisions made by the fitr to decisions made in an institutionbased evaluation of fitness in several samples . in the first sample , the overall rate of agreement between the fitr and institutionbased judgments was eighty seven percent , and the falsenegative error rate was two percent . the second sample yielded comparable results . boddy , roesch , zapf , and eaves compared defendants who were referred for fitness evaluations , including those who were eventually found unfit , and defendants who were not referred . performance on the fitr effectively distinguished these groups , such that referred defendants demonstrated significantly more impairment . as additional evidence of the construct validity of the fitr , zapf and roesch found reasonably high agreement between judgments made using the fitr and defendant performance on the macarthur competency assessment tool–criminal adjudication . the fitr has also been used in research with young offenders . georgia court competency test . the georgia court competency test was originally developed by wildman et al . and has since gone through a number of revisions . the original version consisted of seventeen items , and the revised version , referred to as the mississippi state hospital revision , consists of twenty one items . the first seven items of the gcctmsh require the defendant to visually identify the location of certain participants in the courtroom using a courtroom drawing as a reference . this is followed by questions related to the function of certain individuals in the courtroom , the charges that the defendant is facing , and his or her relationship with the lawyer . research on the gcctmsh has indicated that this instrument displays strong reliability and validity evidence . three factors identified by nicholson et al . courtroom layout , general legal knowledge , and specific legal knowledge were later replicated by bagby et al . . it was later suggested that this threefactor solution may be appropriate only for defendants who have been ordered to undergo assessment at the pretrial stage . these researchers indicated that a twofactor solution may be more appropriate for defendants who have been adjudicated incompetent and who are undergoing inpatient treatment to restore competence . the major drawback of the gcctmsh is that it focuses on foundational competencies and generally ignores the more important decisional competencies stressed in the ifi and fit approaches . macarthur competence assessment tool criminal adjudication . the macarthur competence assessment tool–criminal adjudication was developed to assess three main subconstructs of the psycholegal abilities : understanding , reasoning , and appreciation . it comprises twenty two items that are grouped into three sections . the examiner begins by reading a hypothetical vignette to the defendant to ground the first two sections . the first section assesses the defendant ability to understand information about the legal system and the process . for each item , the defendant is asked a question related to the vignette and is awarded two points if he or she is able to answer the question in a manner that demonstrates full understanding . if the defendant earns fewer than two points , the examiner discloses the answer and asks the defendant to repeat the disclosure in his or her own words . the purpose of the disclosure is to independently assess the defendant capacity to understand and his or her actual or preexisting understanding . the second section assesses the defendant ability to reason . the first five items in this section assess the defendant ability to consider two pieces of factual information and identify the most important or legally relevant piece of information that should be disclosed to a lawyer . the last three items require the defendant to think through mock legal options and to evaluate them in various ways . the final section assesses the defendant ability to appreciate his or her own legal circumstances and situation . this section departs from the hypothetical vignette format to explore the defendant beliefs and perceptions about his or her personal role as a defendant and how he or she will be treated during the course of adjudication . these items are scored on the basis of the reasons that the defendant provides for his or her judgment and whether they are plausible or implausible . it is important to note that the authors of the maccatca emphasize that this instrument was developed for use as a tool rather than a test of competence and that it constitutes only one component of an overall assessment of competence . thus , the scores obtained must be interpreted within the context of the specific defendant case and integrated with all the other clinically relevant factors that may surround the specific circumstances of the case . the psychometric properties of the maccatca were examined based on a sample of seven hundred and twenty nine felony defendants in eight different states . the results indicated that the maccatca demonstrated high levels of reliability . for each of the three sections , internal consistency ranged from eighty one1 to eighty eight8 , and interrater reliability ranged from very good to excellent . otto and colleagues reported that additional support for the construct validity of the maccatca was  found in the pattern of correlations between the maccatca measures and select clinical variables  . maccatca understanding , reasoning , and appreciation scores correlated with estimated wechsler adult intelligence scale revised full scale iq scores , and with brief psychiatric rating scale total scores . the three maccatca scales correlated moderately with clinicians ’ global ratings of competency . evaluation of competency to stand trial revised . the evaluation of competency to stand trial–revised was developed to structure an examiner judgments about a defendant competencerelated abilities and to provide normative data in this regard . the ecstr represents the first formal competency assessment instrument created specifically to serve , in part , as a screener of feigned incompetency and consists of four scales . three of these scales were designed to tap into the three dusky prongs : consult with counsel , factual understanding of the courtroom proceedings , and rational understanding of the courtroom proceedings . the fourth scale , atypical presentation , is a response style measure consisting of five subscales : realistic , psychotic , nonpsychotic , impairment , and both . the cc scale is composed of ten questions with five criteria rated on a fivepoint scale , wherein zero = not observed ; one = questionable clinical significance ; two = mild impairment ; three = moderate impairment , unrelated competency ; and four = severe impairment , directly related to competency . some of these items have more than one component to rate , and the highest score given is used toward the total scale score . the fu scale consists of fifteen questions with thirteen criteria . with one exception , items are rated on a fivepoint scale , wherein zero = correct , one = correct when prompted , two = correct with attempts to educate , three = wrong despite attempts to educate , and four = grossly psychotic and totally unrelated to the question . the exception is item twelvea , which is coded either zero = understands risk of talking to prosecutor or one = does not understand risk . in recent years , attention has been paid to two specific populations for whom issues of competency are especially important for various reasons juveniles and individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities or mental retardation . this section examines some of the issues relevant to the assessment of competence for these special populations , including descriptions of instruments that have been developed to assess competencerelated abilities within these populations . relatively few researchers and scholars have addressed the problems faced by individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities within the criminal justice system . bonnie noted that one of the biggest problems for these individuals is underidentification . that is , a considerable number of defendants diagnosed with mr are not referred for psychological evaluations , and a general failure to recognize the magnitude and/or existence of the disabilities of such individuals is a major cause of the low rate of referrals . although the underidentification hypothesis is widely accepted among researchers and scholars , there are few empirical data to support it . failure to identify individuals with intellectual disabilities and subsequently refer them for evaluations of competency is often a result of the tendency of these individuals to attempt to hide their limitations . that is , persons diagnosed with mr are often compliant and cooperative with authority figures , such as judges or lawyers , and are likely to pretend to understand their lawyers when , in fact , they may not . research by everington , notariosmull , and horton suggests that defendants diagnosed with mr may be able to hide their deficits in certain circumstances . nevertheless , in many cases , a  cloak of competence  gives these individuals the appearance of normalcy in the competency context . legally significant impairments then become visible only when the individual also has a severe mental illness or acts in a strange or disruptive manner . it is common for these individuals to proceed to trial without ever having been identified and , consequently , to proceed through the criminal justice system without understanding  the process or punishment , often unknowingly participating in agreements that can result in grave and longlasting consequences  . the misidentification of individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities can result in a loss of liberty and the violation of the right to a fair trial . once individuals diagnosed with mr have been identified , it is important that an examiner who is familiar with the specific issues relevant to the diagnosis conduct the evaluation . petrella noted that the probability of an adequate evaluation of issues involving such a diagnosis is highly unlikely for several reasons , including the fact that many evaluators are not qualified to administer intelligence tests , evaluators may have minimal experience with mr and limited exposure to the unique clinical presentation of individuals with such a diagnosis , referrals to professionals and experts in the area of intellectual disability per se seldom occur , and professionals with specific expertise with such persons usually have minimal or no experience with forensic issues . research examining the rates of incompetence among defendants with mr has provided conflicting findings . in missouri , seventeen percent of defendants referred for competence evaluations and diagnosed with mr were adjudicated incompetent whereas in connecticut and michigan , rates of incompetence were reported to be twelve percent and thirty three percent , respectively . in addition , the probability of being found incompetent also varies by severity of the defendant intellectual limitations . in a virginia study , twenty three percent of defendants diagnosed with mild mr were deemed incompetent , whereas sixty eight percent of those with moderate mr were found incompetent . in terms of restoration to competency for individuals diagnosed with mr , bonnie hypothesized that the possibility of restoration is highly unlikely . in a sample of thirty eight incompetent defendants with such a diagnosis in virginia , only sixteen percent were considered likely to be restored , and it was estimated that restoration was unlikely for approximately sixty six percent of the defendants . in a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four study of two hundred and seventy one defendants diagnosed with mr and committed to a special competence restoration program , individuals with higher iqs were more likely to be found competent or restored to competence . in addition , the author concluded that the absence of comorbidity was associated with restorability , as only three percent of those with comorbid disorders were restored to competence as compared to approximately twenty percent of those without comorbid disorders . although further research certainly is required in this area , research efforts that have examined issues of intellectual disability within the criminal justice system beginning in the early nineteen nineties can be viewed as a step in the right direction . the nineteen nineties also saw an increase in research examining issues of competency within the juvenile population . competency has become more important for adolescents , because the juvenile justice system has shifted to a more punishmentoriented model as opposed to a rehabilitative one , and increasing numbers of adolescents are being either waived or transferred to adult court . research on competency to stand trial in juveniles has examined issues related to the evaluation of developmental maturity , decisionmaking abilities , and other factors that might impact adjudicative competence . in addition , comparisons of juveniles ’ competencerelated abilities with those of adults has been the focus of much research and scholarly writing , and numerous studies have found age and competency to be negatively correlated , such that younger children are more likely to be found incompetent . as the focus of this chapter is on competency to stand trial in adults , the reader is referred to additional sources for more indepth information related to juvenile competency . specialized measures of competency . in recent years , there has been a move toward the development of competence assessment instruments for specialized populations of defendants , such as defendants diagnosed with mr or juvenile defendants . next we briefly describe some of the recent advances in these areas . competence assessment for standing trial for defendants with mental retardation . everington developed an instrument designed to assess competence with defendants diagnosed with mr called the competence assessment for standing trial for defendants with mental retardation . the items of the castmr were derived from a review of relevant literature , case law , and existing competency to stand trial assessment instruments . the castmr consists of fifty questions , which are administered orally to the defendant . the questions are divided into three sections that address the basic elements of the dusky standard . section i , basic legal concepts , includes twenty five multiplechoice items that address concepts related to the criminal trial process and terms that are critical to the trial process . section ii , skills to assist defense , is comprised of fifteen multiplechoice items that address the attorney–client relationship . items on sections i and ii are scored as either correct or incorrect . section iii , understanding case events , consists of ten openended questions designed to assess the defendant ability to describe the relevant circumstances of his or her offense . items are scored as one point , one point , or zero points based on the ability of the individual to relay information regarding his or her case in an accurate and understandable manner . applying psychology to criminal proceedings . the castmr was developed to assist in the determination of the competency of a defendant diagnosed with mr. the authors of the castmr emphasized its use as only one component of an overall assessment . results of the castmr should be considered in the context of other relevant information , such as interviews , observations , and social history . the authors of this instrument conducted two validation studies to investigate the psychometric properties of the castmr . the results indicated that the instrument has good reliability and validity . reliability and validity findings were similar to those found with other competency assessment instruments . results from the first study demonstrated that the internal consistency of the castmr total score was ninety three3 when estimated by cronbach alpha and ninety two2 when estimated by the kuder richardson method . the results from the second study were consistent with those of the previous study . internal consistency of the total score using the kuder richardson method was estimated between ninety two2 for kr formula twenty and ninety two2 for kr formula twenty one. these findings indicate that the castmr has a high level of homogeneity . test–retest reliability was estimated twice at eighty nine9 and ninety0 . interrater reliability for section iii was estimated between eighty percent and eighty seven percent . juvenile measures of competency . the juvenile adjudicative competence interview is an interview guide for clinicians that provides standardized questions to assist in the evaluation of developmentally sensitive information relevant to competency to stand trial for juveniles . the jaci covers twelve primary areas of evaluation : . the macarthur judgment evaluation was developed for use in the assessment of immaturity of judgment in juveniles . similar to the maccatca , the macjen utilizes a vignettebased procedure to address three types of legal decisions typically involved in the criminal process : responding to police interrogations after the commission of a crime , disclosing information to one defense attorney , and responding to a plea agreement and testifying against other defendants . respondents are to choose among various options and are asked to recommend a best and worst choice for the person in the vignette . research studies have been conducted using the macjen ; however , it is not available for use in clinical settings . we conclude our chapter with a discussion of several issues to which examiners must pay special attention when conducting an evaluation of competency . prior to interviewing a defendant , it is good clinical practice to speak with the defense attorneys to determine as accurately as possible why the fitness issue was raised , what evidence was offered , and which trial and dispositional alternatives are being considered by both parties . all indications of prior mental health contacts should be pursued before the interview takes place so that the examiner has as complete a set of mental health records as possible . similarly , police reports of the alleged offense are necessary and a criminal history record is helpful , particularly if the defendant has cycled through the criminal justice and mental health systems several times . if the defendant is an inpatient , institutional records and progress notes should be reviewed as well as all available psychological test data . finally , the examiner should maintain an accurate record of when , where , and how information about the defendant was made available as well as a date and time record of all contacts with the defendant , attorneys , other mental health professionals , and other collateral informants . these records are invaluable at later stages if legal tactics designed to confuse or mislead a witness are attempted . having prepared for an examination in this fashion , one can conduct an efficient and comprehensive interview in a relatively brief period of time . most delays in conducting an evaluation and , therefore , time spent on inpatient status can be largely avoided , and a more relevant examination conducted , if these steps are taken . prior to the interview , the defendant should be provided with proper informed consent or notification , including being informed about the parameters of confidentiality . the possibility of recording the interview should be considered . the examiner should be aware of any aspects of the interview and the resulting report that are covered by statute or accepted practice within the jurisdiction . as an example of the former , some states require notifications that inform the defendant of the limitations of confidentiality that may apply . similarly , other states dictate the form of the report to the court , and an examiner report may be excluded if it does not comply with the required format . in people v. harris , for example , a psychiatrist report was excluded , and the defendant subsequent conviction was reversed because the opinion was presented in conclusory terms and failed to provide the clinical facts and reasons upon which it was based , thus precluding the trier of fact from independently assessing the weight to be given such an opinion . the current competency statutes in illinois , florida , and utah are in many ways models of this developing trend , insofar as they require examiners to identify the factual bases for their conclusions and opinions , describe the defendant mental and physical disabilities and how these may impair his or her ability to understand the proceedings and assist in the defense , discuss the likelihood that the defendant will respond to a specified course of treatment , and explain procedures that would be employed to compensate for the defendant disabilities , if applicable . we applaud this sort of specification and urge examiners to adopt the practice , even if it is not mandated in their own jurisdiction . competency evaluations and the associated reports prepared for the court should be completed in accordance with both the spirit and the letter of the law . the examiner must be thoroughly acquainted with the legal literature and in some sense anticipate developments in one practice . for example , per estelle v. smith , it is clearly prohibited to introduce material obtained under courtordered competency proceedings at a  critical  stage of trial . many states mirror this in their statutes but do not regulate the common practice of requesting competency and insanity evaluations at the same time , often resulting in a combined report . we believe this practice is improper , and recommend that separate interviews , with distinct reports , be prepared when possible . the trier of fact is required to separate these issues ; however , it is virtually impossible to do so when the reports are combined . a defendant who is clearly psychotic and  legally insane  at the time of an assault may respond rapidly to treatment upon arrest and be nonpsychotic and  legally fit  when actually examined . caution and fairness dictate keeping the reports separate when possible so that the courts can consider the two issues independently . this chapter touches on only a small selection of the vast amount of research and writing on competence to stand trial . the purpose of this chapter was to provide the reader with a brief overview of competency law , research , and assessment . for a comprehensive review of empirical research on competence to stand trial , the reader is referred to grisso , cooper and grisso , and mumley et al . . these authors reviewed the research on the evaluation of competence in three fiveyear intervals . as well , pirelli , gottdiener , and zapf conducted a metaanalysis using sixty eight studies and over twenty defendants that provides a quantitative review of the comparative research on competence . pirelli , zapf , and gottdiener set forth a number of guidelines intended to serve as a reference for those conducting research in this area . finally , zapf and roesch presented a full consideration of best practices in the evaluation of competency to stand trial . these references as well as those listed in the introductory paragraph of this chapter will provide the reader with a more indepth understanding of competency to stand trial .

       "'ASSESSMENT OF MENTAL STATE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE. The evaluation process generally includes three major components or sources from which to elicit data: (1) an interview with the defendant; (2) traditional and/or forensic assessment instruments; and (3) third-party information, including but not limited to collateral reports, witness statements, victim statements, police reports, and records of various sorts (i.e., mental health, treatment, school, medical, crime scene). Each of these three major sources of data is reviewed next; however, the reader is referred to additional sources for more comprehensive and detailed infor-mation about the assessment process (see Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 2007; Packer, 2009; Rogers & Shuman, 2000). In addition, we include a section on the role of delusions in evaluations of criminal responsibility, because the nature and quality of a defendant’s thought process is often central in determining the extent of impairment in mental state at the time of the offense (MSO), particularly in contested cases. Inception . In addition to rapport building, the inception relates to informed consent or notification, such that it requires clearly explaining one’s role to the defendant, focusing on why he or she is being evaluated, who will have access to the information gathered, and what limits are placed on the confidentiality of information. These confidentiality rules vary widely across jurisdictions and are strongly influenced by the context of the case; therefore, the examiner must be fully informed in this regard, as a matter of professional competence. In most jurisdictions, once defendants have entered their mental state into the adjudication process by interposing an insanity defense or some other mental state claim, no information revealed to the examiner that can be construed as relevant to that claim is protected. Jurisdictions differ widely, however, as to whether indirect fruits of such evidence are admissible; hence, extreme caution is required when preparing a report. The broadest coverage is found in the federal courts:    No statement made by a defendant in the course of any [forensic] examination . . . with or without the defendant’s consent, no testimony by the expert based on the statement, and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant has introduced [evidence]. (Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 12.2 (c) 4, 2011)  As noted earlier, however, jurisdictions vary widely, and the examiner must conform his or her practice to the local rules. It is also good practice to allow the defendant to provide his or her version of the events surrounding the time of the offense (the “filtered version”) before the examiner introduces any contradictory evidence or challenges the defendant on any noted inconsistencies. Near the end of the interview, the examiner may choose to introduce contradictory evidence in an effort to observe the defendant’s reaction, evaluate the defendant’s response style, and determine whether he or she is consciously distorting facts or experiencing bona fide memory-related difficulties.    Reconnaissance. This is a forensically oriented review of the defendant’s history. It is important to obtain information regarding the defendant’s history of psy-chiatric disturbance, treatments received, and general experience of his or her psychiatric condition. Of particular importance are prior episodes that may have involved criminal charges and/or competency evaluations, civil commitments, or other such dispositions. The pattern of mental state disturbance, its relationship to psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatment, medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism), situational stressors, and substance use are particularly important.    Detailed Inquiries—Present Mental State and Mental State at Offense. Typically, it is difficult to separate these concepts, because a disturbed defendant usually will be treated with rapidly acting psychotropic medications. Nevertheless, it is crucial to bear in mind that these mental states, although related, are separable, albeit with great difficulty. Forensic evaluators need to be concerned with “Riggins factors,” (Riggins v. Nevada, 1992), that is, alternations in the individual’s mental state as a function of psychotropic medication. Within the context of MSO evaluations, defendants are likely to have been treated with psychotropic medications for a long time period following the alleged incident but prior to the evaluation. This can be problematic as the defendant’s ability to recall and describe his or her prior mental state accurately is potentially impaired.  We advise the use of sections of structured and semistructured interviews to cover the domain of psychopathology in a relatively standardized fashion to improve interexaminer reliability in the elicitation and coding of information. The detailed inquiry with respect to the defendant’s MSO must also focus on the relationship of the psychopathological elements to the criminal conduct charged. Doing this often involves comparing the defendant’s reports of his or her mental state and behaviors with various aspects of crime scene evidence. This part of the interview resembles a psychological autopsy. The defendant must be asked to reconstruct his or her thoughts, perceptions, experiences, attitudes, and behavior, as well as those in the field of action during the entire legally significant period. Retrospective evaluations present challenges for laypersons, jurors, judges, and examiners alike; therefore, great care must be taken to obtain detailed information and also to avoid, as much as possible, recall-based contamination of the defendant’s memories.  Reconciliation and Termination. As emphasized by many advocates and critics of the role of the forensic examiner in the legal process (see Bonnie & Slobogin, 1980; Ferguson & Ogloff, 2011; Melton et al., 2007), the role of the expert is not to present legal conclusions or formal psychopathological diagnoses. Rather, the role of examiner, as expert, is to import state-of-the-art scientific knowledge about the existence of various psychiatric conditions and their relationship to behavioral, perceptual, cognitive, and judgmental capacities into the legal/moral decisional process. Thus, at the reconciliation or termination phase, the examiner should be prepared to integrate the information available at this level and to inform all parties concerned, including, as appropriate, the defendant, defense counsel, prosecutor, and other mental health professionals. One advantage of this openness is that it allows the defendant to produce any additional information that might explain or clarify discrepancies, and it also helps prevent an uninformed battle of the experts. In certain gray-area cases, there may be legitimate disagreements among experts. It assists the trier of fact if the nature of these disagreements, as well as areas of agreement, are drawn as precisely as possible, with each examiner fully aware and able to comment in advance as to the reasons for disagreement. Such pretestimony consultations also tend to produce higher-quality and more informative strategies for direct and cross-examination.    FORENSIC ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS. Two specialized forensic assessment instruments have been developed to assist in the evaluation of MSO. Although both of these instruments were developed in the 1980s, standards of forensic practice continue to move in the direction of incorporating forensic assessment instruments in the evaluation of psycholegal issues.   Mental State at the Time of Offense Screening Evaluation. The Mental State at the Time of the Offense Screening Evaluation (MSE; Slobogin, Melton, & Showalter, 1984) is a semistructured interview technique developed to screen out defendants for whom an insanity defense is clearly not applicable. In addition, the MSE can also be used to identify those individuals who are “obviously insane” and therefore do not require a more comprehensive evaluation. The MSE is composed of three sections:  historical information, which assesses a defendant’s premorbid psychological and cognitive functioning; (2) offense information, which accumulates information regarding the offense from the defendant and external sources; and (3) present mental status examination.  Although there have not been any published studies of the reliability of the MSE, its validity was evaluated by Slobogin and colleagues (1984). Twenty-four mental health professionals were trained to use the MSE and were then asked to assess 36 cases. They were given only a description of the charge and the preliminary hearing transcript prior to their assessment. Their decisions were then compared to the decisions of an inpatient forensic evaluation team, which included one psychiatrist, one psychologist, and one social worker. Overall, there was satisfactory agreement (72%, or 26 of 36 cases) between trainees and the evaluation team. There was 44% agreement (16 of 36 cases) on the cases that were screened out. Using the decisions made by the evaluation team as the criterion, the decisions made by the trainees were found to have a 0% false-negative rate and a 28% (10 cases) false-positive rate (“screened in” defendants who were screened out by the evaluation team). Compared to the evaluation team’s decisions, the trainees’ decisions had less agreement with the court’s verdict. Of the 10 defendants for whom the evaluation team suspected some “significant mental abnormality,” 1 was convicted, 7 had their charges nolle prossed (prosecution decided not to pursue the case), and 2 were found insane. Of the 20 defendants whom the trainees suspected had some “significant mental abnormality,” 6 were convicted as charged, 4 were convicted of a lesser charge, 6 had charges nolle prossed, and 2 were found insane.  The limitations of the MSE have been addressed in the literature (see Poythress, Melton, Petrila, & Slobogin, 2000; Rogers & Shuman, 2000). Given the lack of research on its reliability and the limited validity data available, the MSE should be viewed as a guide for evaluators to ensure that relevant areas of inquiry are addressed. Indeed, evaluators can include the MSE (or the R-CRAS, discussed next) in a comprehensive evaluation that would include multiple sources of data (e.g., psychological tests, third-party information, defendant’s interview).  Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scales. The Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scales (R-CRAS; Rogers, 1984) were designed to quantify the elements of the ALI criteria for criminal nonresponsibility; however, Rogers noted that it might be applicable to the M’Naughten standard as well (Rogers & Shuman, 2000). Based on a comprehensive evaluation, the examiner rates the defendant with respect to a series of scales grouped into five areas: (1) reliability of report,  organicity, (3) psychopathology, (4) cognitive control, and (5) behavioral control. For example, the psychopathology section involves ratings of bizarre behavior, anxiety, amnesia, delusions, hallucinations, depressed or elevated mood, verbal coherence, and affective and thought disorder. In addition, there is a series of more global ratings on final judgments of insanity and impairment. Thus, the R-CRAS is an instrument that reflects the relative importance assigned by examiners to the first-order elements of an insanity decision (e.g., the presence and relevance of psychopathology to MSO). It should be noted that these elements are fairly abstract psychological and legal terms (e.g., “delusions at the time of alleged crime”) and do not necessarily represent the cues that are actually utilized by professional examiners in making their decisions. This was a major issue of contention among Rogers, Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slogobin (1997), and Golding (1992) in the evaluation of this instrument. Rogers believes it is important to quantify the issue; however, it would be unfair to assume that he did not recognize the value of qualitative data (see Rogers & Ewing, 1992). Golding and Melton et al. agreed that quantification is essentially illusory at this stage in the development of evaluations of criminal responsibility. Both groups of authors agree, in large measure, on the domains or conceptual elements to be addressed.  Rogers and Sewell (1999) responded to the criticisms of Melton et al. (1997) by attempting to extend the R-CRAS’s construct validity via the reanalysis of two data sets to address contributions of individual variables to the various components of the decision model. On the basis of discriminant function analysis, the authors concluded that the R-CRAS variables were able to form differentiating patterns (between individuals showing impairment and those not showing impairment) for each of the five components of the decision model. Results indicated average hit rates of 94.3% (ranging from 87.8% for major mental disorder to 97.2% for cognitive control), and the average variance accounted for was 63.7% (ranging from 38.5% for malingering to 79.2% for behavioral control).  Factor analysis of the R-CRAS items has resulted in three factors—bizarre behav-ior, high activity, and high anxiety—that do not mirror the five scales (see Borum, 2003). Rogers has reported modest interrater reliabilities at the item level (average Kappa 0.58), with lower values (0.49) associated with the product question (i.e., was the loss of control attributable to underlying psychopathological disturbance?), which is one of the most frequent sources of disagreement in contested trials (Rogers & Shuman, 2000; Rogers, Wasyliw, & Cavanaugh, 1984). Final judgments with the R-CRAS have also been associated with reasonable levels of agreement between examiners and triers of fact (96% with respect to sanity with lower levels of agreement on insanity [70%]; Rogers, Cavanaugh, Seman, & Harris, 1984; see Rogers & Shuman, 2000, for a summary). These findings are in general accord with the levels of agreement found between clinicians and courts in other studies of final judgment that use no formalized interviews or rating scales (Golding, 1992). Unfortunately, all studies in this area appear to use criterion-contaminated groups, because the examination process was part of the judicial (criterial) determination.  A number of proposals for semistructured protocols to assist in the evaluation of mental state at time of the offense have been made (see, e.g., Golding & Roesch, 1987; Melton et al., 2007; Ogloff, Roberts, & Roesch, 1993). They share in common an open-ended structure, with special attention to developing multisource data, identification of legally and psychologically relevant dimensions of the criminal responsibility evaluation, and disclosure of the logical links in an evaluator’s reasoning. The need to develop such a comprehensive analysis is clear. These less structured approaches have been shown to be empirically useful in various contexts (see Melton et al., 2007, for a review), but they have not been studied in the same fashion as the R-CRAS. The R-CRAS and less structured MSO evaluation techniques make their most important contributions by clarifying the underlying bases for professional judgment for the trier of fact (Golding, 1990, 1992), thus potentially highlighting the areas of disagreement so that expert testimony can be of more assistance to judge or juror. There is much reason to believe that forensic examiners reach their generally high level of agreement in “ultimate opinions” by different logical and empirically sustainable routes. The critical issue remains the association between organic or psychopathological disturbance and control/moral judgment capacities; these devices are most useful when they serve the heuristic value of (a) highlighting the aspects of the defendant’s psychological state that are relevant, (b) describing a purported relationship to control and judgment capacities, and (c) organizing known data about the empirical relationships between disorder and psychological capacities in various states and situations.  THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION. It is a commonly accepted standard of practice that forensic evaluators examine the consistency of mental health history and other archival data along with details of the crime scene and witnesses’ accounts of the defendant before, during, and after the alleged incident. This consideration of “consistency” is relevant to issues of malingering and aids in supporting or challenging various psychological inter-pretations of the defendant’s MSO. The importance of this aspect of a forensic examination at the time of the offense has been addressed in numerous sources (see Melton et al., 2007; Packer, 2009; Rogers & Shuman, 2000). Forensic evaluators need to pay close attention to crime scene data as well as to more traditional sources of third-party information (e.g., mental health and other records, witness statements). All such sources need to be integrated in as straightforward a manner as possible. Where limited scientific data exist to support the inference (e.g., descriptive studies of the characteristics of hallucinations or delusions), they should be referenced, and where otherwise indicated, the evaluator’s logical link analysis should be presented and scrutinized.  As Melton et al. (2007) noted, the role of the forensic evaluator is not to conclusively resolve all conflicting accounts about the case but rather to conduct an evaluation that can be scrutinized in terms of all available evidence, both psychological and behavioral. Modern forensic standards of practice are to address the issue of the consistency of behavioral crime scene evidence with psycholegal formulations and allow the trier of fact to make the determination of their significance, guided by whatever scientific evidence can be directly or indirectly adduced.  ROLE OF DELUSIONS IN ASSESSMENT OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY. The nature and quality of a defendant’s delusions are central in determining the extent of impairment impacting his or her MSO. Several issues are involved.  APPLYING PSYCHOLOGY TO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. In contested cases, forensic examiners are particularly apt to encounter defendants with extreme or idiosyncratic beliefs about religion, politics, or personal identity, and questions regarding the delusional basis for those beliefs will arise. Delu-sionality also enters the adjudicatory process when the issues of intentionality, compulsion, or the reasonableness of the defendant’s conduct may be related to a delusion. Finally, delusionality is an important aspect of risk assessment with respect to release decisions.  Although there are surprisingly few studies on the frequency and nature of delusions of NGRI defendants, indirect data, as well as experience, suggest that delusionality is a vital issue (see Litwack, 2003, for a discussion of defendants who refuse to mount an insanity defense on the basis of delusional reasoning). Delusions (especially delusions of reference, persecution, and control, which are particularly relevant to forensic cases) are prevalent among individuals with psychotic disorders (Winters & Neale, 1983). Furthermore, roughly half of defendants who raise the insanity defense and 70% of insanity acquittees have psychotic diagnoses (Stead-man & Braff, 1983). Moreover, delusions have been shown to be specifically and substantially related to violence (Taylor et al., 1994).  In an extensive analysis of case records, Hafner¨ and Boker¨ (1982) found that 70% of individuals who were diagnosed with schizophrenia and accused of homicide harbored delusional beliefs about their relationship with their victim. Similarly, in an interview-based study, Taylor (1985) found that 40% of psychotic defendants reported acting directly on their delusions during their offenses. The frequency of nonpathological but radical religious and/or political beliefs, and the extent of the relationship between these beliefs and violence, have not been systematically studied (Taylor et al., 1994); however, defendants whose criminal acts are related to such fervently held beliefs are clearly plausible candidates for MSO evaluations wherein a primary focus will be the determination of whether these extreme beliefs are delusional.  Distinguishing between radical beliefs and delusions is a difficult, but critical, task in the assessment of criminal responsibility. Respecting the principles of autonomy and self-determination, our legal system holds responsible the extremist who chooses to act on a radical system of beliefs, expressing his or her desires, values, and “personhood” through the crime (see Hermann, 1990). The basic moral logic of the insanity defense, however, excuses the mentally disordered individual who acts on a pathological, uncontrollable belief system that distorts his or her sense of reality, thereby impairing the capacity for rational choice. Arguably, the same logic also applies to delusions that would “justify” the actions.  Notwithstanding the centrality of this issue in assessing criminal responsibility, there are few empirical studies or practice standards available to aid in assessing the delusionality of beliefs. In gray-area cases, or cases in which defendants are not clearly disordered, the classification of beliefs as delusional is presumably a major source of disagreement among examiners. There is no bright line of demarcation between extreme beliefs and delusions (Garety & Hemsley, 1994; Oltmanns, 1988).'"

       "'assessment of mental state at the time of the offense . the evaluation process generally includes three major components or sources from which to elicit data : an interview with the defendant ; traditional and/or forensic assessment instruments ; and thirdparty information , including but not limited to collateral reports , witness statements , victim statements , police reports , and records of various sorts . each of these three major sources of data is reviewed next ; however , the reader is referred to additional sources for more comprehensive and detailed information about the assessment process . in addition , we include a section on the role of delusions in evaluations of criminal responsibility , because the nature and quality of a defendant thought process is often central in determining the extent of impairment in mental state at the time of the offense , particularly in contested cases . inception . in addition to rapport building , the inception relates to informed consent or notification , such that it requires clearly explaining one role to the defendant , focusing on why he or she is being evaluated , who will have access to the information gathered , and what limits are placed on the confidentiality of information . these confidentiality rules vary widely across jurisdictions and are strongly influenced by the context of the case ; therefore , the examiner must be fully informed in this regard , as a matter of professional competence . in most jurisdictions , once defendants have entered their mental state into the adjudication process by interposing an insanity defense or some other mental state claim , no information revealed to the examiner that can be construed as relevant to that claim is protected . jurisdictions differ widely , however , as to whether indirect fruits of such evidence are admissible ; hence , extreme caution is required when preparing a report . the broadest coverage is found in the federal courts : no statement made by a defendant in the course of any examination . . . with or without the defendant consent , no testimony by the expert based on the statement , and no other fruits of the statement may be admitted into evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant has introduced . four , two thousand and eleven ) as noted earlier , however , jurisdictions vary widely , and the examiner must conform his or her practice to the local rules . it is also good practice to allow the defendant to provide his or her version of the events surrounding the time of the offense before the examiner introduces any contradictory evidence or challenges the defendant on any noted inconsistencies . near the end of the interview , the examiner may choose to introduce contradictory evidence in an effort to observe the defendant reaction , evaluate the defendant response style , and determine whether he or she is consciously distorting facts or experiencing bona fide memoryrelated difficulties . reconnaissance . this is a forensically oriented review of the defendant history . it is important to obtain information regarding the defendant history of psychiatric disturbance , treatments received , and general experience of his or her psychiatric condition . of particular importance are prior episodes that may have involved criminal charges and/or competency evaluations , civil commitments , or other such dispositions . the pattern of mental state disturbance , its relationship to psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatment , medical conditions , situational stressors , and substance use are particularly important . detailed inquiries present mental state and mental state at offense . typically , it is difficult to separate these concepts , because a disturbed defendant usually will be treated with rapidly acting psychotropic medications . nevertheless , it is crucial to bear in mind that these mental states , although related , are separable , albeit with great difficulty . forensic evaluators need to be concerned with  riggins factors ,  , that is , alternations in the individual mental state as a function of psychotropic medication . within the context of mso evaluations , defendants are likely to have been treated with psychotropic medications for a long time period following the alleged incident but prior to the evaluation . this can be problematic as the defendant ability to recall and describe his or her prior mental state accurately is potentially impaired . we advise the use of sections of structured and semistructured interviews to cover the domain of psychopathology in a relatively standardized fashion to improve interexaminer reliability in the elicitation and coding of information . the detailed inquiry with respect to the defendant mso must also focus on the relationship of the psychopathological elements to the criminal conduct charged . doing this often involves comparing the defendant reports of his or her mental state and behaviors with various aspects of crime scene evidence . this part of the interview resembles a psychological autopsy . the defendant must be asked to reconstruct his or her thoughts , perceptions , experiences , attitudes , and behavior , as well as those in the field of action during the entire legally significant period . retrospective evaluations present challenges for laypersons , jurors , judges , and examiners alike ; therefore , great care must be taken to obtain detailed information and also to avoid , as much as possible , recallbased contamination of the defendant memories . reconciliation and termination . as emphasized by many advocates and critics of the role of the forensic examiner in the legal process , the role of the expert is not to present legal conclusions or formal psychopathological diagnoses . rather , the role of examiner , as expert , is to import state-of-theart scientific knowledge about the existence of various psychiatric conditions and their relationship to behavioral , perceptual , cognitive , and judgmental capacities into the legal/moral decisional process . thus , at the reconciliation or termination phase , the examiner should be prepared to integrate the information available at this level and to inform all parties concerned , including , as appropriate , the defendant , defense counsel , prosecutor , and other mental health professionals . one advantage of this openness is that it allows the defendant to produce any additional information that might explain or clarify discrepancies , and it also helps prevent an uninformed battle of the experts . in certain grayarea cases , there may be legitimate disagreements among experts . it assists the trier of fact if the nature of these disagreements , as well as areas of agreement , are drawn as precisely as possible , with each examiner fully aware and able to comment in advance as to the reasons for disagreement . such pretestimony consultations also tend to produce higherquality and more informative strategies for direct and crossexamination . forensic assessment instruments . two specialized forensic assessment instruments have been developed to assist in the evaluation of mso . although both of these instruments were developed in the nineteen eighties , standards of forensic practice continue to move in the direction of incorporating forensic assessment instruments in the evaluation of psycholegal issues . mental state at the time of offense screening evaluation . the mental state at the time of the offense screening evaluation is a semistructured interview technique developed to screen out defendants for whom an insanity defense is clearly not applicable . in addition , the mse can also be used to identify those individuals who are  obviously insane  and therefore do not require a more comprehensive evaluation . the mse is composed of three sections : historical information , which assesses a defendant premorbid psychological and cognitive functioning ; offense information , which accumulates information regarding the offense from the defendant and external sources ; and present mental status examination . although there have not been any published studies of the reliability of the mse , its validity was evaluated by slobogin and colleagues . twentyfour mental health professionals were trained to use the mse and were then asked to assess thirty six cases . they were given only a description of the charge and the preliminary hearing transcript prior to their assessment . their decisions were then compared to the decisions of an inpatient forensic evaluation team , which included one psychiatrist , one psychologist , and one social worker . overall , there was satisfactory agreement between trainees and the evaluation team . there was forty four percent agreement on the cases that were screened out . using the decisions made by the evaluation team as the criterion , the decisions made by the trainees were found to have a zero percent falsenegative rate and a twenty eight percent falsepositive rate . compared to the evaluation team decisions , the trainees ’ decisions had less agreement with the court verdict . of the ten defendants for whom the evaluation team suspected some  significant mental abnormality ,  one was convicted , seven had their charges nolle prossed , and two were found insane . of the twenty defendants whom the trainees suspected had some  significant mental abnormality ,  six were convicted as charged , four were convicted of a lesser charge , six had charges nolle prossed , and two were found insane . the limitations of the mse have been addressed in the literature . given the lack of research on its reliability and the limited validity data available , the mse should be viewed as a guide for evaluators to ensure that relevant areas of inquiry are addressed . indeed , evaluators can include the mse in a comprehensive evaluation that would include multiple sources of data . rogers criminal responsibility assessment scales . the rogers criminal responsibility assessment scales were designed to quantify the elements of the ali criteria for criminal nonresponsibility ; however , rogers noted that it might be applicable to the m ’ naughten standard as well . based on a comprehensive evaluation , the examiner rates the defendant with respect to a series of scales grouped into five areas : reliability of report , organicity , psychopathology , cognitive control , and behavioral control . for example , the psychopathology section involves ratings of bizarre behavior , anxiety , amnesia , delusions , hallucinations , depressed or elevated mood , verbal coherence , and affective and thought disorder . in addition , there is a series of more global ratings on final judgments of insanity and impairment . thus , the rcras is an instrument that reflects the relative importance assigned by examiners to the firstorder elements of an insanity decision . it should be noted that these elements are fairly abstract psychological and legal terms and do not necessarily represent the cues that are actually utilized by professional examiners in making their decisions . this was a major issue of contention among rogers , melton , petrila , poythress , and slogobin , and golding in the evaluation of this instrument . rogers believes it is important to quantify the issue ;

       "'assessing violence risk . in a variety of contexts , our legal system allows for or requires assessments of risk for violence of certain individuals . that is , the law requires assessments of the risk that those individuals will cause certain types of harm under particular conditions within particular periods of time . such assessments , currently most commonly labeled violence risk assessments , can significantly affect the lives of those individuals and , if a serious proclivity toward violence goes undetected , perhaps others that is , potential victims as well . mental health professionals are often called on , and may even be obliged , to participate in these decisions . although the flurry of foundational riskrelevant legal activity waned to some extent in north america throughout the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties , if one looks globally , there is no shortage of the enshrinement of risk within law and policy . this chapter addresses violence risk assessments , historically referred to as assessments of dangerousness , concerning mentally or personality disordered individuals possibly at risk for violence in the community . first , we review some of the landmark commentary , case law , and research that spurred the proliferation of risk assessment research and professional activity . we then review the major approaches to risk assessment , their advantages and disadvantages , and corresponding research . then we provide a step-by-step overview of the clinical risk assessment process . next , we survey recent developments in the law that concern the admissibility in court of such assessments and the legal standards for depriving individuals of their liberty based on such assessments . we conclude by recommending several fruitful areas for research and practice concerning violence risk assessment to tackle . landmark early research and commentary . the first comprehensive review of the research literature regarding assessments of dangerousness by mental health professionals was john monahan influential monograph predicting violent behavior : an assessment of clinical techniques , which appeared in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty one. monahan updated his one thousand, nine hundred and eighty one review in another prominent article published in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty four . litwack and schlesinger reviewed the research literature through one thousand, nine hundred and eighty five for the first edition of the present volume and arrived at conclusions somewhat different from those of monahan . litwack , kirschner , and wack reviewed the relevant studies from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty five to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety and concluded , echoing both monahan and litwack and schlesinger , that  research had not negated the possibility that clinical evaluations of dangerousness can have a unique and useful role to play in making determinations of dangerousness that our society has decided should be made  . litwack and schlesinger updated their review of the literature for the second edition of this handbook and echoed this sentiment . however , in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine , quinsey , harris , rice , and cormier proposed the  complete replacement  of clinical assessments of dangerousness with actuarial methods . in response , litwack reviewed the studies directly comparing clinical with actuarial risk assessments and concluded that  research to date has not demonstrated that actuarial methods of risk assessment are superior to clinical methods.  rather , he proposed ,  it seems that much more research is needed to determine the relative merits of clinical versus actuarial assessments of dangerousness and that such research should be conducted in as meaningful a manner as possible  . here we review some of the most prominent early studies of violence risk assessment both because of their continuing notoriety and because they illustrate important points that should be considered in evaluating most research studies regarding assessments of dangerousness and/or the assessments themselves . then we consider major research studies published in recent years to evaluate the current state of research findings concerning violence risk assessments . the most widely cited study for the oftenstated proposition that predictions of violence by mental health professionals are wrong at least two times out of three , even when based on a known history of violence and extensive clinical examinations , is a study by kozol , boucher , and garofalo . a close examination of this study illustrates , however , how cautious one should be before drawing firm conclusions from many early studies of assessments of dangerousness . using clinical examinations , extensive life histories , and psychological tests , a team of mental health professionals evaluated five hundred and ninety two males convicted of assaultive offenses and sentenced to a special facility for continued evaluation and treatment . of these men , three hundred and eighty six were eventually classified as not dangerous by the evaluating team and released . in addition , forty nine men classified as still dangerous were also released by legal authorities against the advice of the professional staff . during a fiveyear community followup , eight percent of the patients considered by the evaluating teams to be not dangerous were found to have committed a serious assaultive crime . by contrast , thirty five percent of the patients viewed as dangerous by clinicians , but nevertheless released , were discovered to have committed a serious crime . on the surface , the clinicians studied here did appear to do much better than chance in their evaluations because the recidivism rate of offender patients released against the advice of the evaluating teams was much higher than the recidivism rate of patients evaluated to be no longer dangerous . however , it appears from the report that the examinees deemed dangerous but nevertheless released were , on average , at risk for recidivism in the community for a significantly longer period than those released after clinical judgments of nondangerousness . thus , it can not be definitively concluded from this study that the clinicians at issue demonstrated at least some ability to assess dangerousness . however , for the reasons that follow , neither should it be concluded from this study that  predictions of violence  by mental health professionals are wrong at least twothirds of the time . to begin with , kozol , boucher , and garofalo reported subsequently that at least fourteen of their forty nine patients classified as dangerous and yet released were patients who had been committed and studied during the early years of their program and who would not have been considered to be dangerous in the later years of their study . thus , kozol et al . eventually may have developed an assessment system that was able to predict which of their sample of patients would be dangerous if released with at least fifty percent accuracy . second , the recidivism rate reported by kozol et al . for the patients deemed dangerous whether thirty five percent or fifty percent was presumably lower than the actual recidivism rate . hall has pointed out that there is good reason to believe that only twenty percent of serious crimes lead to an arrest . thus , many seeming false positives may , in fact , be undiscovered true positives . third , the forty nine patients released despite clinical judgments of dangerousness were not a representative sample of patients judged to be dangerous by the clinicians in this study . because these forty nine individuals were released by judicial or parole authorities against professional advice , they were almost certainly patients whose dangerousness was in fact uncertain . why else , in the main , would they have been released ? however , if the far larger number of patients classified as dangerous by the teams and legal authorities and not released had been released , their rate of recidivism and the apparent accuracy of the clinical assessments might have been far higher than it appeared to be for the patients whose dangerousness was questionable . thus , this study simply does not demonstrate that predictions of violence by mental health professionals are likely to be wrong twothirds of the time , regardless of the sample of individuals being evaluated , the circumstances involved , or the confidence of the clinicians in their judgments . finally , and most important , the judgments of dangerousness at issue in this study , like most judgments of dangerousness , were never predictions of violence to begin with . the patients supposedly predicted to be violent were actually , and more conservatively ,  not recommended for release  . clinical concerns regarding a patient potential dangerousness that lead to a conclusion that the patient can not be recommended for release do not equate with a prediction that a patient will be violent if released . a clinical judgment that a patient is dangerous , even a judgment that an individual is sufficiently dangerous to warrant confinement , is rarely , if ever , a prediction that a patient unquestionably will be violent if at liberty or , at least , if unsupervised . rather , almost always , it is a judgment that the subject poses a significant risk of acting violently in certain circumstances . indeed , in forensic settings , patients with a history of serious violence may well be deemed a continued danger by clinicians and judges even if it clearly could not be concluded with confidence that those patients would recidivate if released , as long as it is determined that the patients are still significantly at risk for serious recidivism . that is , a clinical conclusion that a patient can not be recommended for release or even a conclusion that a patient remains dangerous may simply be a determination that the patient remains prone to violence under certain circumstances . violence may or may not actually occur , depending on the totality of the clinical picture . thus , if a patient deemed by a clinician to be too dangerous to be recommended for release is nevertheless released and does not recidivate , it is incorrect to conclude that the clinician made an inaccurate prediction . to the contrary , although the clinician may have concluded that the risk of causing harm still posed by the patient was too great to recommend the patient for release , the clinician may also have concluded that the patient might well not recidivate . this fact poses serious difficulties for attempts to evaluate the validity of clinical assessments of dangerousness or the relative merits of clinical versus actuarial assessments . baxstrom and dixon studies . other historically important studies of violence risk assessments by mental health professionals are the wellknown baxstrom studies and the similar study of the dixon patients by thornberry and jacoby . briefly stated , these studies concerned hundreds of individuals confined for many years in forensic hospitals because they were considered to be too dangerous to be released to civil hospitals , much less to the community . yet , as a result of judicial decisions , these patients were nevertheless transferred to civil hospitals . followup studies indicated that only a small percentage had to be returned to secure facilities and only a small number of patients ultimately released to the community were rearrested for violent offenses . these findings indicate that , in the past , many mentally ill individuals were wrongfully confined in unduly restrictive facilities because of erroneous assumptions that they were too dangerous to live in less restrictive conditions ; therefore , determinations of dangerousness for the purpose of preventive detention warrant careful judicial scrutiny . but it is equally clear that the determinations of dangerousness on which the unnecessarily severe confinements were grounded were not based on careful , individualized assessments but on what have been described as administrative decisions , global assessments , and  political predictions  . nor is there any evidence that the psychiatrists who made those determinations were anything like a representative sample of psychiatrists . indeed , given the fact that many of these patients had grown old , it is hard to believe that a representative sample of mental health professionals would have determined so many of them to be seriously dangerous . indeed , litwack described a representative sample of patients confined on the grounds of dangerousness in a secure forensic facility and compared his sample to thornberry and jacoby sample . litwack concluded that the samples and assessment techniques employed were so different that  the validity , or invalidity , of the ‘ predictions ’ of dangerousness at issue in the study of the dixon patients utterly irrelevant to evaluating the validity and/or legitimacy of the assessments of dangerousness  he surveyed . moreover , litwack pointed out ,  once even a semblance of an individualized examination was performed . . . on the dixon patients , only a distinct minority were still deemed to be dangerous  . in short , it is wrong to draw conclusions about assessments of dangerousness in other much less all circumstances from findings regarding such assessments in particular circumstances . these few studies , spurred in large part by legal decisions , are foundational within the violence risk assessment field . they raised alarm bells among the legal and mental health professions in terms of the supposed inability of mental health professionals to predict violence . despite drawing harsh conclusions about clinical ineptitude based on less-than-optimal data or actual clinical risk assessments , these few studies , perhaps ironically , are likely the reason that the contemporary risk assessment field has received as much attention as it has . we now shift our attention to more contemporary themes . contemporary models of violence risk assessment . although unstructured clinical prediction still may be the most common approach to risk assessment , generally , as described here , it is not a model of risk assessment per se . in terms of specific , defined models , two primary contemporary models of violence risk assessment are commonly used in applied settings : actuarial and structured professional judgment . there has been a vast amount of research on these models , particularly spj , since the previous edition of this volume . the actuarial method is rooted in the classic human decision making debate between clinical prediction and actuarial prediction . as we reviewed earlier , correctly or otherwise , much of the early research on violence risk assessment or  dangerousness  led investigators to conclude that clinical predictions by mental health professionals were poor . research on actuarial risk assessment was spurred by these dismal conclusions . and , in part , spj arose out of perceived weaknesses in the unstructured clinical and actuarial approaches . next we review these approaches , including their primary features and their pros and cons . following that , we review research addressing their validity . clinical judgment . unstructured clinical judgment is not a model of risk assessment per se . in fact , it was described by meehl as an approach that lacks rules . it is based on professional opinion , experience , and intuition , and clinicians have absolute discretion in terms of the risk factors they rely on and how to integrate them . as grove and meehl wrote , clinical prediction is an  informal , ‘ in the head , ’ impressionistic , subjective conclusion , reached by a human clinical judge  . although we believe that clinical experience is essential for conducting risk assessments , we also believe that exercising such experience within a structured decisionmaking context is necessary . although the traditional definition of clinical prediction stressed the absence of rules and the unfettered application of unchecked intuition , clinicians may and do take into account whatever available data they deem relevant to their assessments , including data that can be obtained only through clinical methods . thus , although clinicians undoubtedly vary in their knowledge of which factors to consider when evaluating dangerousness and in their ability to properly assess and weigh those factors , we in fact do not accept the notion , suggested by others , that clinical judgments are merely  subjective  or  impressionistic.  rather , as holt aptly noted decades ago ,  disciplined analytical judgment is generally better than global , diffuse judgment ; but it is not any the less clinical.  despite these caveats , we address the unstructured clinical judgment  model  next . strengths and weaknesses of unstructured clinical discretion . using clinical judgment does have benefits , including being able to respond to rare or unusual circumstances and to important elements of the individual case . this fosters case conceptualization and individualized risk management plans . however , a purely unstructured approach has substantial weaknesses , given the absence of guidance to decision makers . for instance , clinicians may pay undue attention to factors that are not associated with violence . conversely , they may fail to attend to important factors that are indeed associated with violence . given a complete absence of structure , there may be inconsistency across raters as well as inconsistency within raters but across cases . therefore , over time , it is probable that use of this decision approach will produce decisions of lower reliability that are less strongly related to violence than a structured approach . guy metaanalysis , for instance , showed that unstructured approaches were significantly less strongly related to violence than were structured approaches . furthermore , from an ethical perspective , entirely unstructured approaches are problematic , because the final decision may rest on unspecified factors and processes . that is , there may be little transparency in unstructured clinical decision making , which poses problems in legal settings because such decisions can not adequately be reviewed . this places examinees ’ rights , as well as continuity of care , at jeopardy . actuarial prediction . by contrast , the actuarial approach to prediction is  a formal method  that  uses an equation , a formula , a graph , or an actuarial table to arrive at a probability , or expected value , of some outcome  . the defining feature of the actuarial prediction method is the derivation and use of replicable , routinized rules for combining or integrating predictive factors . risk factors are selected because they are predictive of violence and are combined based on their joint predictive qualities in the derivation sample . major contemporary actuarial instruments are listed in table fourteen strengths and weaknesses of actuarial decision making . actuarial prediction methods may possess good reliability , because the methods for using their risk factors are explicit . this can also produce good predictive validity in comparison with unstructured approaches . in addition , the transparency of these methods is a benefit in legal contexts . the predictive properties of most actuarial risk assessment instruments tend to be optimized within a derivation sample . often only one sample is used , and the results may not be crossvalidated prior to use . this practice is highly problematic because derivation predictive estimates which are linked to the specific characteristics of unique samples tend to change upon crossvalidation in new samples . as such , actuarial risk assessment instruments produce estimated probabilities of violence over some future time for persons who fall into certain score ranges on the test . the actuarial approach has a number of vulnerabilities that have yet to be overcome in the risk assessment field . first , most actuarial instruments contain risk factors that were demonstrated to be predictive of violence in one sample . although this procedure does indeed demonstrate what variables were predictive in that given sample , there is no guarantee that the same variables will be predictive in other samples or that only those risk factors will be associated with violence in other samples . that is , given myriad sample characteristics , it is possible that actuarial instruments contain samplespecific risk factors and exclude important risk factors with broad support in the literature . strict actuarial approaches disallow consideration of risk factors not included on the instrument . these approaches presume that the original research considered all potentially relevant risk factors and all potentially relevant risk factors are contained on the instrument . moreover , if weighting of risk factors is involved , as it often is , the actuarial approach presumes that all risk factors would be weighted equivalently in different samples . further , attaching weights to risk factors presumes not only that they will apply equally across samples but that they apply equally to all persons within samples . that is , if , say , substance abuse receives a weight of twice that of psychopathy on some actuarial measure , the implied presumption is that substance abuse is twice as important as psychopathy for all persons to whom the instrument might be applied . this is a very high bar to set , and one that we do not think has been met in the risk assessment field . a major problem with the actuarial approach stems from its sample dependence . risk factors are selected through certain statistical procedures and given weights through one of any number of methods . as a result , the estimated probabilities of violence are all dependent on a host of samplespecific characteristics . these include , inter alia , the initial selection of candidate risk factors , how they were measured , how reliable their measurement was , sample size , length of followup , nature of the sample mix , definition of violence , and method of detecting violence . sample dependence means that estimated probabilities of violence may change if the instrument is used in new samples . therefore , actuarial estimates might not be stable across new samples and , unless demonstrated to be so , ought not be assumed to be so . indeed , the onus of demonstrating the stability lies on those who use actuarial methods . to further muddy the waters , it is unclear whether samplebased estimates should be applied to the individuals within those samples at all . hart , michie , and cooke calculated confidence intervals for the vrag and ninety nineatic99 at both the group level and the individual level . their argument was that , if precise actuarial estimates are used at the case level , they ought to be shown to possess meaningful precision at that level . their findings indicated that cis at the individual level were so broad as to render individual level prediction meaningless . although some commentators have taken issue with the calculation of cis at the individual level to start with , at the very least their work highlights the great difficulty of applying groupbased probability estimates to individual persons within those groups . we illustrate some of these problems . earlier we noted that one problem with actuarial methods is the exclusion of potentially important risk factors either because they were not included among the set of candidate variables in the first place or because they did not  make it  onto the final instrument in the given derivation sample . consider the ninety nineatic99 , a widely used actuarial instrument for sexual violence risk assessment . it omits sexual deviation , even though this risk factor is related to violence across numerous samples . as another example , the vrag fails to contain various risk factors that have a good deal of empirical support , such as treatment noncompliance and anger . strictly speaking , from an actuarial perspective , this means that evaluators should not consider these risk factors , because they are not contained on the given instrument . in our view , this highly limits the scope and comprehensiveness of a risk assessment , to the extent that risk factors of potentially vital importance would not be considered by the decision maker . correlation was reduced from forty four4 in the development sample to thirty six6 in authorconducted crossvalidations and to thirty0 in independent samples . similar reductions were observed for the sorag and ninety nineatic99 . although the blair et al . metaanalysis focused on correlational effect sizes , the findings suggest that the frequency estimates produced by some actuarial instruments may not generalize either . mills , jones , and kroner tested the generalizability of such frequency estimates among two hundred and nine offenders using the vrag and the level of service inventory–revised . they concluded that the  results of this study do not support the generalizability of the original probabilities associated with the prediction bins , although the lsir bins performed much better than the vrag bins  and that  this study does not support the use of the initial validation probability bins of either instrument with our sample  . they further found that for the vrag , there were  probability reversals  across its various categories , in which categories with higher estimates that should have had correspondingly higher observed recidivism rates actually produced lower recidivism rates . based on the foregoing , it does not appear that the promise of actuarial instruments has been realized . it is highly likely that persons who score higher compared to lower on these instruments are indeed at higher risk for future violence . research tells us as much . however , it is not clear that we are able to ascribe precise probability estimates at the level of the individual person as opposed to the level of the sample or population . some of the other criticisms of actuarial approaches concern their tenuous relevance to treatment and risk management , which are highly dependent on dynamic risk , or the ability of risk factors to change over time . although actuarial instruments are not inherently static , they tend to include mainly historical factors and do not emphasize repeated measurements to capture change as part of their prescribed use . we focus more on this issue next as we discuss the spj approach . structured professional judgment . the spj approach to violence risk assessment has been in development since the early to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety990s . it developed , in part , to compensate for the weaknesses of both the unstructured clinical and the actuarial approaches . however , it also aims to retain some of the strengths of both approaches . having said that , it is not a combination of approaches , and it is not an  adjustedactuarial  approach . in general , spj attempts to retain some of the strengths of the clinical approach , such as its relevance to treatment and risk management and its utility in individual case formulation . in addition , like the actuarial approach , it aims to attain solid empirical evidence and to couch professional judgments within a structured context . examples of major spj instruments are provided in table fourteen next we briefly describe the main features of the spj approach . the later section on the clinical assessment of risk expands on the details of how to use it . all spj risk instruments use logical or rational item selection to select risk factors of relevance to the form of violence addressed by the particular spj measure . this approach fosters generalizability of risk assessments across applications as well as comprehensiveness of the set of risk factors on spj instruments . logical item selection is a process involving a thorough review of scientific , theoretical , and professional literatures on the topic of relevance and the selection of risk factors with broad support across a number of numerous samples and contexts . its purpose is to derive a set of risk factors that minimizes the likelihood that important risk factors are excluded from an assessment or that irrelevant factors are included . this approach is not sample dependent , and hence risk factors generalize across settings . this approach contrasts with the empirical item selection approach used by most actuarial methods , the weaknesses of which were outlined earlier . unlike an unstructured clinical approach , it also ensures that an a priori , standard set of risk factors is considered by all clinicians for any case . for reasons reviewed earlier when discussing the weaknesses of actuarial approaches , spj instruments do not use numeric score cutoffs to categorize people , nor do they use numeric probability or frequency estimates of future risk for violence . spj approaches require decision makers to classify individuals as low , moderate , or high risk depending on their perceived level of risk and the corresponding required degree or amount of intervention to dampen this risk . clinicians consider the number and relevance of risk factors that are present in a given case . high risk means that an examinee is considered high priority by the evaluator for receiving risk management or reduction interventions , without which the evaluator is confident that the examinee would commit a violent act . although some commentators have criticized the lack of a numerical assignment system , research shows that this decisionmaking system is as accurate as or more accurate than actuarial classification systems . spj approaches do not provide a priori weighting to risk factors , as most actuarial instruments do . that is , in most spj measures , all factors are judged to be present , absent , or partially/possibly present . then , based on the given case , clinicians decide which risk factors are more versus less relevant in that case . there is no presumption , as there is in actuarial models , that all risk factors are related to violence in the same manner for all persons across all samples . decision makers consider the presence of risk factors that have empirical support at the nomothetic level as well as the risk factors ’ individual relevance at the idiographic level . all spj violence risk instruments include dynamic risk factors . this fosters treatment and risk management planning . as described , the absence of dynamic risk is not an inherent property of actuarial instruments . however , most such instruments tend not to include an emphasis on dynamic risk , which limits their applicability to monitoring risk over time . the spj model helps clinicians decide how often to reevaluate risk factors and how to link risk assessment to risk management . all spj violence risk instruments contain numerous potentially changeable risk factors that inform clinicians ’ judgments about what sort of risk reduction strategies are necessary in a given case . facilitation of risk management . comparative evaluative research . how do these approaches fare , both singly and comparatively , in terms of evaluating risk for violence ? in this section , we draw some conclusions from the literature on this topic . there are now hundreds of risk assessment studies especially on actuarial and spj approaches . after a review of landmark studies of unstructured clinical judgment , we focus on metaanalytic studies devoted to contemporary actuarial and spj instruments as well as illustrative comparative studies . for detailed commentary on early developmental research on key actuarial instruments such as the vrag and covr , please see the third edition of this handbook . landmark studies on clinical prediction . in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety three , lidz , mulvey , and gardner published a study on clinical violence risk assessments that was deemed by monahan in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety six to be , at that time ,  surely the most sophisticated study published on the clinical prediction of violence  . the lidz et al . study remains apposite , and we review it in some detail . in general , this research concluded that mental health professionals ’ clinical judgments were significantly predictive of psychiatric patients ’ violence . pairs of clinicians were asked to independently rate hundreds of psychiatric emergency department patients on a scale from one to five regarding the patients ’  potential . . . violence toward others during the next six months.  patients who received a summed rating of at least three out of a possible score of ten were included in the  predicted violent  group . each of these patients was then matched for sex , race , and age with another emergency room patient who had elicited less staff concern about future violence to others . ultimately , three hundred and fifty seven matched pairs were followed for six months after their discharge from the hospital . violent incidents were detected in thirty six percent of the comparison cases and fifty three percent of the predicted cases , a statistically significant difference . even when the patients ’ preadmission history of violence was controlled for , the clinicians still did statistically better than chance , leading the authors to conclude that  this study . . . show that clinical judgment has been undervalued in previous research  . however , because a significant percentage of the patients who did act violently in the community were not identified as dangerous by the clinicians and because a considerable percentage of patients who did not act violently in the community were in the predicted violent group , the authors also concluded that  the low sensitivity and specificity of these judgments show that clinicians are relatively inaccurate predictors of violence  . furthermore , although this study showed that clinicians , generally , did better than chance at predicting violence , this was true only for male patients . prediction for female patients was no better than chance . clinicians underestimated the risk posed by women . although it was estimated to be about half that of men , in fact the men and women had similar base rates of violence in the followup period . and in a followup analysis of these data , coontz , lidz , and mulvey showed that clinicians spent much less time asking questions about violence to female patients compared to male patients who had recently been violent . moreover , in further followup analyses , gardner , lidz , mulvey , and shaw showed that a simple , threeitem actuarial screen outperformed clinicians ’ decisions . thus , this study , considered one of the best to test clinicians ’ predictions , showed lukewarm support for clinicians ’ validity . the clinical predictions showed some association with violence but also showed a good deal of error , inapplicability for women , and inferior performance to a simple actuarial screen . despite the value of these lessons learned , there are other questions about what exactly can be drawn from this study . to begin with , the clinicians in this study were not predicting violence but instead rating their patients ’ potential for violence . it is simply incorrect to conclude that a patient who elicited some clinical concern regarding future dangerousness has been predicted to be violent . lidz et al . did find that patients about whom clinicians expressed serious concern those who had a summed score of six or above were no more likely to commit violence than patients regarding whom the clinicians had expressed some but less concern . however , a high clinical rating of potential violence does not necessarily mean a judgment that the patient is very likely to commit violence . such a concern may instead reflect a judgment that the patient is at risk for committing serious violence , even if the risk of occurrence is not high . that is , the concept of risk is not equivalent to the concept of probability or likelihood . according to the law as well as social science , the concept of risk includes consideration of the nature , severity , imminence , and frequency or duration of harm as well as its likelihood . thus , a clinical opinion of high risk could reflect a belief that the patient poses some significant possibility of serious violence , a high probability of minor violence , or a moderate probability of imminent violence . moreover , this study certainly does not demonstrate that psychiatric emergency room clinicians have sufficient ability to assess future dangerousness to justify emergency commitments based on their assessments of dangerousness . this is because the followup measures and analysis , however much a step forward from past efforts , did not assess a crucial variable : whether the patients ’ violence in the community , when it occurred , was sufficiently serious and occurred sufficiently soon after their return to the community that would have justified continued confinement had it been foreseen . even if clinicians can do better than chance when they assess dangerousness , this is a far cry from concluding that they can assess dangerousness sufficiently well to justify depriving a person of liberty based on such an assessment . as is discussed in more detail later ,  clear and convincing evidence  of dangerousness is required to justify an extended civil commitment . that a clinical determination of dangerousness can be shown to be likely to be somewhat better than a random judgment that is , better than chance does not render that judgment , in and of itself ,  clear and convincing evidence  of dangerousness . to put it another way , statistical significance may not amount to legal significance . further , to have maximum legal utility , risk assessment methods should assess the risk of legally relevant possible violence that is , violence of legally relevant seriousness , likelihood , and/or imminence . furthermore , the comparison to the actuarial screen may not be entirely appropriate . these analyses compared actuarial and clinical predictions of violence for their accuracy in predicting any community violence versus predicting serious community violence . actuarial predictions had lower rates of falsepositive and falsenegative errors than the clinical predictions for any violence . however , the actuarial instruments were not superior to clinical judgments in predicting serious violence , which is the issue of practical concern . even more important , data regarding three of the most critical variables in the actuarial prediction equation were collected from patients not in the emergency room but in the community after their discharge from the hospital . these variables were the patient score on the hostility subscale of the brief symptom inventory , the patient recent history of drug abuse , and the patient recent history of violence . gardner , lidz , mulvey , and shaw reported that a simple decision tree relying on these three variables and age less than eighteen predicted future violence as well as a regressionbased method using these and other variables . however , it is questionable , at best , whether the data required for the decision tree could be validly and reliably collected in the emergency room , given patients ’ clinical conditions at that time . at the least , therefore , this study did not convincingly demonstrate that actuarial methods are superior to clinical methods in determining which patients evaluated in psychiatric emergency rooms should or should not be hospitalized involuntarily . to the contrary , because the clinicians in gardner et al. studies did as well as the actuarial scheme in predicting future serious violence , and because there is every reason to believe that the necessary actuarial data would not have been nearly as valid if collected in the emergency room if it could have been collected there at all there is every reason to suppose that clinicians are superior to actuarial methods in determining shortterm serious dangerousness regarding individuals brought for evaluation to psychiatric emergency rooms . in an early metaanalysis of sixty four prospective studies of predictors of violence among mentally disordered offenders , bonta , law , and hanson compared  objective risk  assessments to clinical judgment . objective assessments produced a relatively strong predictive effect and were considerably more strongly related to general recidivism than clinical judgment . a similar pattern was reported for violent recidivism . it should be noted that the  objective risk  assessments included very few of the major contemporary measures used today and also included studyspecific actuarial procedures that were not crossvalidated . nonetheless , this metaanalysis showed that , at least among mentally disordered offenders , clinical judgment was systematically less strongly related to future violence than actuarial approaches . campbell , french , and gendreau metaanalyzed eighty eight studies from between one thousand, nine hundred and eighty and two thousand and six. their primary outcome variable was general recidivism among adults , although subanalyses focused on violent recidivism . instruments that had the largest number of evaluations were evaluated separately to facilitate crossinstrument comparison . the authors were able to do this for these instruments : twentyr20 ; psychopathy checklist–revised ; statistical information on recidivism ; the vrag ; and the level of service family of instruments , which includes the original level of supervision inventory and its revisions , the lsir and the level of service/ case management inventory . in general , the cis overlapped for most instruments , meaning that no clear  winner  emerged . for institutional violence , effect sizes ranged from a low of eight8 to a high of twenty eight8. for violent recidivism , they ranged from twenty two2 to thirty two2. for violent recidivism , instruments that contained dynamic risk factors intending to focus on risk management and treatment produced larger effect sizes than those without such a focus . in the previously described metaanalysis by blair et al . , the authors reported effect sizes for the vrag , sorag , and ninety nineatic99 that were generally in the moderate range . however , there was a clear decrease in sizes of effects as one progressed from development samples , to instrument authorconducted studies employing crossvalidation samples , through independent crossvalidation samples . across all three instruments , correlational effect sizes decreased from thirty nine9 to thirty six6 to twenty eight8 . the primary point here is that one can expect the predictive accuracy of actuarial risk assessment instruments to decrease on crossvalidation . hanson and mortonbourgon evaluated one hundred and eighteen studies examining sex offender risk assessment . they classified assessments as actuarial , spj , and unstructured clinical prediction , and they classified outcomes as  any ,   violent ,  and  sexual.  their main conclusion was that actuarial assessments were more accurate than unstructured clinical judgments for each type of outcome . spj measures were intermediate . actuarial estimates also tended to produce larger effect sizes than spj measures for sexual recidivism , although there were only six spj studies , and only three of these used summary risk ratings as opposed to the summation of scores . the single instrument with the largest effect sizes with sexual recidivism was the twentyr20 , an spj measure , although this was based on only three studies . the authors advised that given the small number of spj studies , caution is warranted in evaluating spj instruments based on this particular metaanalysis . olver , stockdale , and wormith focused on three specific instruments for their metaanalysis of risk assessment of young offenders . one instrument the hare psychopathy checklist–revised : youth version is not a risk assessment instrument per se , but they included it for comparative purposes , because psychopathy instruments are commonly used in risk assessment . the authors identified forty four usable studies and compared outcomes across general , violent , nonviolent , and sexual recidivism . none of the measures was specifically developed to assess the risk for sexual recidivism , and none performed well for this outcome . as with other metaanalyses , there were not large differences between measures , each performing comparably and moderately . more specifically , for the structured assessment of violence risk in youth , effect sizes ranged from thirty0 to thirty eight8. for the youth level of service/case management inventory , the range was twenty six6 to thirty two2 , and for the pcl : yv , it was sixteen6 to twenty eight8. in another metaanalysis focusing on young offenders , although specifically on sexual violence , viljoen , mordell , and beneteau again reported no meaningful differences between the four instruments they evaluated . across thirty three studies , effect sizes for sexual recidivism were in the small to moderate range . yang , wong , and coid were specifically interested in comparing individual measures in their metaanalysis of nine measures across twenty eight studies . they were also interested in focusing on contemporary instruments and using the pclr as a benchmark . that is , to what extent do measures improve on the pclr ? further , they investigated the extent to which study features versus specific instruments accounted for differences in predictive effects of instruments across studies . most instruments had moderate predictive validity , and there were few differences between instruments . only about twenty five percent of the variance in effect sizes was attributable to instruments , meaning that much of the difference between effect sizes was attributable to study design features . one standout finding was that the interpersonal/affective aspects of the pclr were substantially less predictive compared to the risk assessment instruments and to the other features of the pclr . only two instruments , across various statistical models , added incremental validity to the pclr : the twentyr20 and the offender group reconviction scale . however , only two studies of the ogrs permitted this comparison , compared to sixteen for the twentyr20 . another , very focused , metaanalysis compared the twentyr20 and pclr in thirty four samples in which both instruments were included . although focused , this metaanalysis contains more twentyr20/pclr comparisons than do other metaanalyses . the authors reported that , in general , the instruments performed the same . when the psychopathy item was removed from the twentyr20 , the instrument auc essentially remained unchanged . most interestingly , the authors secured seven raw data sets and were able to conduct head-to-head multivariate analyses of the twentyr20 and the pclr . the twentyr20 added unique , incremental validity beyond the pclr , whereas the converse was not true . specifically , using metaanalytic logistic regression , the authors reported that , with both instruments included in the analysis , for every onepoint increase on the twentyr20 , the probability of detecting violence increased twenty three percent , whereas for every onepoint increase on the pclr , the probability of detecting violence decreased by one percent . in yet another metaanalysis , the authors were interested in determining whether certain instruments were more accurate than others and whether features of study design impacted accuracy . across eighty eight independent studies published between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five and two thousand and eight , the authors evaluated nine instruments . although eighty eight studies were included in the metaanalysis , instrumentspecific analyses typically were based on no more than twelve studies and typically fewer than ten. also unlike most previous metaanalyses , they coded instruments into predictive  bins  of low versus high risk . for spj instruments , the analysis was based on the nonnumeric summary risk ratings of low , moderate , and high risk . for actuarial instruments , the authors similarly reduced the numeric score categories into two bins . unlike most previous metaanalyses , they argued that there were indeed differences between measures in terms of predictive accuracy . they reported that the savry produced the largest effect and the ls and pcl measures produced the smallest . the authors interpreted this finding to mean that instruments designed to assess risk in specific populations were more accurate than those designed for more general use or those not designed specifically for risk assessment . consistent with this interpretation , the authors also reported that instruments designed to predict violence fared better than those designed to predict general recidivism . this latter finding was also observed in a recent metaanalysis on an overlapping group of seventy three studies . in this latter metaanalysis , instruments designed to assess risk for violence , collapsed across actuarialspj assessment format , had superior predictive validity than did those instruments designed or used for general criminality , odds ratios of six versus two , respectively . it should be pointed out , however , that differences between the savry and the ls family of instruments are only somewhat meaningful , in that the savry was designed specifically for youth violence whereas the ls family spans youth and adulthood , and most studies were based on the adult ls measures . that is , generally , these differences in effect sizes do not compare instruments that would be used with the same populations . in terms of comparing spj and actuarial instruments , spj instruments produced diagnostic odds ratios that were larger than those for actuarial instruments , although these differences were not significant . most potential moderators were not significant , including gender , country , setting , and ethnicity , although there was a small trend for assessments to be more accurate among samples with a greater percentage of older , caucasian participants . regrettably , most risk assessment metaanalyses suffer the same flaw : they fail to include the summary risk ratings commonly used with the spj approach . singh et al . is an exception , where they were able to use summary risk ratings for twenty two of twenty seven spj studies . the metaanalysis conducted by hanson and mortonbourgon also is an exception , although there were only three sex offender studies available for analysis that used summary risk ratings . although it is important to know how well spj instruments fare in terms of the sum of their risk factors , as a general indication of whether , in general , more risk factors equates to higher risk , this numeric index is not the one primarily intended to guide clinical practice . as discussed , raters are expected to come to decisions of low , moderate , or high risk based on their consideration of the number and relevance of risk factors and the expected degree of intervention required to reduce risk . in addition to singh et al . , we are aware of only one broad metaanalysis that includes summary risk ratings . although it is unpublished at this time , we review it here , because it exhaustively metaanalyzed all spj literature . guy metaanalysis evaluated one hundred and thirteen spj disseminations and , where possible , compared these to actuarial and unstructured clinical prediction . focusing on spj studies , effect sizes did not differ as a function of gender , europe versus north america , adult versus adolescent , setting , institution versus community , file versus file+interview , or whether authors or translators were involved in the research . guy also compared the numeric use of spj instruments with the use of summary risk ratings . quite consistently , summary risk ratings were more strongly associated with violence relative to numeric use . similar to the findings of singh et al . and fazel et al . , guy reported that the twentyr20 summary risk ratings were more strongly related to outcomes when they focused on violence as opposed to nonviolent or general criminality . this was particularly the case for physical violence . across all available instruments and effect sizes , spj summary risk ratings produced larger effect sizes than actuarial instruments . for unstructured predictions , the effect sizes were on average smaller . based on one composite effect size per study , spj summary risk ratings and actuarial instruments were both stronger than unstructured predictions . in direct comparisons , summary risk ratings and actuarial predictions produced very similar effect sizes that did not differ significantly . three general observations about risk assessment metaanalytic research can be made . it is remarkable how many studies of contemporary risk assessment instruments have been conducted , even in the past ten years . metaanalyses should focus on instruments in the ways that they were intended to be used , as was done by guy , singh et al . , and to a lesser extent hanson and mortonbourgon . most metaanalyses use selection criteria that remove a majority of studies that have been conducted on various instruments . for instance , there have been approximately one hundred studies on the predictive validity of the twentyr20 , yet in most metaanalyses only a small sampling of these studies is included . from a substantive perspective , four conclusions can be drawn . there is very little if any evidence that actuarial methods are more accurate than spj instruments , as is argued by some . indeed , one can fairly state based on metaanalytic evidence that professional , nonactuarial judgments , derived in an spj context , are as strongly or more strongly associated with violence than actuarial methods . there is some evidence that , when instruments are used with the specific outcomes that they were designed to predict , they perform better than when used with nonspecific outcomes . this was evident with the twentyr20 performing better with violence and physical violence than with general antisocial outcomes . instruments designed specifically to evaluate risk for violence seem to perform better than those designed or used to predict general criminal behavior . there is fairly clear evidence for validity shrinkage when using actuarial instruments . in this section , we review the studies that have evaluated the summary risk ratings of low , moderate , and high risk used in the spj approach , especially those that have compared them to the numeric use of such instruments or to actuarial instruments . we do so because this topic has only recently started to work its way into metaanalyses , and there remains less research on this use of the spj model relative to simply summing its risk factors . by our count , a total of thirty four published studies have investigated whether summary risk judgments are predictive of violence . of these thirty four studies , thirty support the use of final spj judgments in violence risk assessment , in that they were significantly predictive of violence . four studies did not find evidence of predictive validity of final spj judgments in predicting violence . in one of these studies that used one spj and three actuarial instruments , none of the instruments predicted violence . similarly , in schaap et al . , none of the twentyr20 or pclr indices were predictive of either general or violent recidivism in this sample of forty five female forensic psychiatric patients . the twentyr20 summary risk ratings produced an auc of sixty five5 , suggesting that low power might have contributed to null findings . in braithewaite et al . , the sample size was only thirty four. in a sample of one hundred and sixty nine male adolescent sex offenders in residential treatment , viljoen et al . found that total savry scores were predictive of nonsexual violence in youth whereas final structured professional ratings were not . of note , the thirty four studies spanned multiple countries canada , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway , portugal , serbia , spain , sweden , the united kingdom , and the united states and included numerous different measures : early assessment risk list for boys ; estimate of risk of adolescent sexual offense recividism ; twentyr20 ; structured assessment of protective factors for violence risk ; sara ; savry ; shortterm assessment of risk and treatability ; start : adolescent version ; sexual violence twentysk–20 . as such , the finding that summary risk ratings are predictive of violence is robust and is so across country and instrument . of the published studies supporting the use of summary risk ratings , half have tested whether final spj judgments added incrementally to the prediction of violence over and above the numerical use of the instrument , or of a pcl measure , an actuarial measure , or unstructured clinical prediction . to test incremental validity , investigators typically use a multivariate regression approach in which the comparison index is entered in the first step of the model and the summary risk ratings are entered as the second step . the key outcome is whether the addition of the summary risk rating adds in a statistically significant manner to the predictive power of the multivariate model . in all but two of the seventeen studies , incremental validity was observed . for instance , twentyr20 summary risk ratings add incremental validity beyond the numeric use of the instrument among mentally disordered offenders , psychiatric inpatients , forensic patients , and criminal offenders released from prison or on probation or parole . a dutch measure modeled after and highly similar to the twentyr20 also showed incremental validity among forensic patients . the start summary risk rating showed incremental validity beyond its own numeric total among forensic psychiatric inpatients , although its adolescent version , the start : av , did not . incremental validity has been shown with the savry in three samples but not in two others . incremental validity of summary risk ratings has also been found with the twentyrl20b in six to twelveyearold boys and the sara in a sample of adult domestic violence offenders . when compared to actuarial tools such as the vrag , the sorag , and the ninety nineatic99 , summary risk ratings of spj instruments tend to have better predictive utility for the outcome of interest . more important , researchers have investigated whether summary risk judgments add predictive validity above and beyond other instruments typically used for violence risk assessment . most such studies have found that summary risk ratings add incrementally to actuarial risk assessment tools . some studies using multivariate analyses have demonstrated that the twentyr20 summary risk judgment added incrementally to the pclr when used to predict violence in samples of criminal offenders and forensic patients . the start summary risk ratings have shown similar incremental validity beyond the screening version of the pcl : sv , as have savry summary risk ratings beyond the pcl : yv . douglas and colleagues found that the twentyr20 and the vrag both accounted for unique variance in predicting violence ; that is , they both added predictive power over the other . lodewijks , doreleijers et al . showed that savry summary risk ratings possess incremental validity beyond unstructured clinical predictions , a finding consistent with guy metaanalytic finding that unstructured predictions were substantially less accurate than spj or actuarial methods . considering all of the empirical evidence , it appears safe to conclude that spj instruments , used in practice as intended , are as accurate as or more accurate than actuarial indices derived from their numeric use , than actuarial instruments , than unstructured clinical prediction , and than pcl instruments . furthermore , they do not suffer the same drawbacks as actuarial methods , discussed earlier . we now turn to a discussion of conducting clinical assessments of risk , with a focus on the steps laid out in the spj model . clinical evaluations of violence risk have been described and discussed for decades . there is good consensus that these evaluations comprise two distinct phases . the first step is to understand an examinee potential for violence . it involves systematic analysis of the examinee violence history , psychosocial adjustment more generally , and living situation . the goal is to understand what kinds of violence examinees might perpetrate , against which people , for which reasons , and under which circumstances . this is sometimes characterized as a process of prediction , although this is true only if the latter term is used loosely to mean understanding what might happen in the future rather than making precise , quantitative , probabilistic estimates of violence . the second step is to determine what events and occurrences might increase or decrease examinees ’ potential for violence . it involves systematic analysis of possible future living situations , both with and without the influence of external agents , to identify putative controlling factors . the goal is to prevent future violence by developing a plan for intervention . this is sometimes characterized as a process of management . although these phases are conceptually distinct , there is some debate concerning whether they are independent or separable . some have argued in favor of this view . they see a simple , linear temporal relation between the two . professionals start by completing the assessment/prediction phase ; then , if needed , they complete the management phase . commentators who hold this view believe that , in certain legal contexts , violence risk assessment requires only prediction that is , the only legally relevant issue is a subject potential for future violence whereas in other legal contexts , as well as all clinical contexts , it requires both prediction and management . others have argued that the relation between prediction and management is bidirectional or recursive . first professionals start the prediction phase ; but the prediction phase segues into the management phase , which may stimulate reiteration of the prediction and , in turn , management phases . according to this view , the prediction and management phases are flip sides of the same coin . each requires the other : good prediction is impossible without systematic consideration of the subject possible future living situations and interventions ; and , conversely , good management is impossible without systematic consideration of the potential for future violence . commentators with this perspective believe that the prediction phase is conditional or contingent on the management phase and that prediction is thus not legally relevant without consideration of management . regardless of how one conceptualizes or defines the process of evaluating violence risk , then , there seems to be unanimous agreement that comprehensive clinical evaluations incorporate both prediction and management . as unstructured clinical judgment by definition does not provide a welldefined framework for either prediction or management , actuarial decision making provides a framework only for prediction . in the remainder of this section we present a framework for comprehensive clinical evaluations of violence risk based on the spj approach . framework based on the spj approach . as discussed previously , the hallmark of the spj approach is that professionals use evidencebased guidelines to structure evaluations of violence risk , but their decisions rely on the exercise of discretion rather than strict adherence to a fixed and explicit algorithm developed a priori . in some respects , it is misleading to speak of an spj approach , as this gives the impression that there is a single , monolithic set of rules to which all those who develop or use spj guidelines adhere . the reality is that various guidelines have been developed by multiple groups working around the world over the past twenty years or so , each geared for different populations of subjects , different groups of users , and different forms of violence . yet these spj guidelines are consistent at the most broad or general level in positing that the task of comprehensive clinical evaluations of violence risk can be broken down into about six major steps : gather critical information . identify the presence of risk factors . evaluate the relevance of risk factors . develop scenarios of violence in light of risk factors that are present and relevant . develop management plans in light of scenarios of violence . communicate the evaluation findings . step one : gather critical information . as scott pointed out ,  before factors can be considered , they must be gathered  . the quantity and quality of information reviewed by evaluators sets fundamental limits on the reliability and validity of their subsequent judgments . with respect to the quantity of information , evaluators should try to gather all the information that is necessary to reach opinions regarding risk in the case , given the context of the evaluation . gathering information requires  patience , thoroughness and persistence . . . rather than diagnostic or interviewing brilliance  and  the painstaking assembling of facts and the checking of information from a variety of sources  . as we noted , however , the context of the evaluation sets limits on the quantity and quality of information available to clinicians . for instance , emergency room clinicians do not have the information or the time available to gather information that clinicians typically have in longterm forensic facilities . information should be gathered about multiple issues or topics and from multiple sources . most spj guidelines make explicit recommendations for gathering information , although the specific topics and sources relevant in a given case vary according to the nature of the risks being assessed and the specifics of the case . for example , information about an examinee sexual functioning is likely to be directly relevant to considering his or her risk for sexual violence but is likely to be less relevant to an evaluation of risk for terroristic violence . one important topic about which information should be gathered in every case is the examinee history of violence . we agree with the sage advice from years ago :  of paramount importance is a meticulous description of the actual assault . . . . the description of the aggressor in action is often the most valuable single source of information  . if there is such a history , the evaluator should construct a timeline of violent incidents to look for evidence of patterns , such as a clear trajectory or triggering events . for each major incident , the evaluator should attempt to determine who was involved , what happened and why , where and when it happened , and the examinee reactions . typically , sources of information will include : interviews with and direct observation of the examinee . interviews with victims of or witnesses to past violence or review of their documented accounts . interviews with collateral informants , such as family members , friends , and coworkers . review of collateral records including but not limited to criminal histories from various agencies , police reports , statements by the examinee , and statements by victims and witnesses concerning past violence ; prosecution and court files ; daily logs from institutional and community corrections ; presentence or predisposition reports ; mental health and medical treatment records ; assessment and treatment reports by civil and forensic mental health consultants ; daily logs from outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities ; and school , employment , and military records . however , in many cases it is impossible to gather and consider all the information available in a given case . evaluators must balance comprehensiveness with efficiency by focusing on information that is useful , unique , and trustworthy . with respect to the quality of information , evaluators must make judgments about the credibility of various sources of information on which they relied and attempt to reconcile any contradictory information . for example , there may be contradictory information concerning the extent of the examinee history of violence or the examinee behavior during the most recent act of violence ; the examinee history of employment or intimate relationship problems may be unclear ; or there may be no information concerning the examinee plans for release from hospital or prison into the community . step two : identify the presence of risk factors . evaluators can not keep in their heads all the information they gathered in its raw or original form ; they simplify it by sorting it into useful units : risk factors . the primary problem here is that evaluators may not use consistent or sensible frameworks to sort information . they may give insufficient weight to risk factors with established validity or too much weight to risk factors of little or questionable validity . worse still , they may use a framework that is implicit , so they are not entirely conscious or selfaware of what they did or did not consider risk factors . spj guidelines structure this part of the evaluation process by giving evaluators a checklist or aide memoire´ of risk factors whose validity is supported by systematic review of the scientific and professional literature . the goal is to focus the attention of evaluators in the first instance on those issues or topics that are considered important in general for evaluations of that sort things that should be considered at a minimum . the list of risk factors is intended to be reasonably thorough or comprehensive but by no means exhaustive ; evaluators are encouraged to go beyond the standard risk factors to identify rare or casespecific risk factors , should they be able to provide a compelling clinical or logical rationale for doing so . we stress that clinicians should be able to articulate a clear rationale for considering casespecific factors and should do so only if it is not possible to capture risk factors with the prespecified list available on the particular instrument . this will help to avoid the inclusion of risk factors that are unlikely to be associated with violence . in addition to identifying risk factors , spj guidelines discuss the nature and definition of the risk factors , summarize the evidence supporting their validity , and provide guidance for determining if they are or have been present over time in the case at hand . most spj guidelines include a minimum of about ten and a maximum of about thirty risk factors , although the number , conceptualization , and definition of risk factors vary across guidelines , according to the nature of the risks being evaluated and the nature of the evaluators who will be using the guidelines or the settings in which they will be used . we have opted in this chapter not to provide a detailed review of important violence risk factors , as they are for the most part very well cataloged on contemporary violence risk assessment instruments . step three : evaluate the relevance of risk factors . risk factors may be relevant in general or on average according to the scientific and professional literature but apparently irrelevant in the case at hand on the basis of idiographic evaluation . the next step , then , is to analyze the risk factors identified as present to make sure they are relevant that is , germane to the examinee risk for violence and the management of that risk . as noted previously , a recent development in the spj approach , reflected most clearly in the twentyr20 three3 , is to encourage evaluators to consider the relevance of each risk factor both individually and collectively . the crux of the issue is aptly delineated by kluckhohn and murray :  very man is in certain respects like all other men , like some other men , like no other man  . in essence , violence risk assessments must investigate all three of these issues . determining relevance is an exercise in abductive inference , that is , inference to the best explanation or , as it is more commonly referred to in clinical practice , formulation . formulation of violence risk should be guided by theory , and it is common in the spj approach to use decision theory . decision theory may be considered a version of a wellestablished theory of criminal behavior known as the psychology of criminal conduct or the general personality and cognitive social learning perspective but tailored specifically to violence . decision theory views violence as a choice . the decision may be made quickly , based on poor information , and with little care and attention that is , it may be a bad decision or a decision made badly but it is a decision nonetheless . the bottom line is that , with very rare exceptions , all people think before they commit violence : they choose whom they commit violence against , when they will commit it , and what kinds of violence they will commit . within the framework of decision theory , it is assumed that before people engage in violence , they have gone through a fourstep thought process : the possibility of acting violently in a given situation entered their conscious awareness , and they entertained this notion rather than dismissing it or pushing it out of their minds . they evaluated the possible positive consequences of violence and determined that it might result in reward or benefit for them . put simply , they perceived that violence might pay off . they evaluated the possible negative consequences of violence and determined that the costs were acceptable . they evaluated their options for committing violence and determined it was feasible . according to the decision theory framework , comprehensive clinical evaluations of violence risk require evaluators to understand how and why examinees decided to engage in violence as well as why they decided not to engage in violence in the past , including the various factors that impinged on or influenced their decision making , and also to understand what interventions , events , and occurrences might encourage examinees ’ decisions to act prosocially and discourage their decisions to act nonviolently . risk factors , then , are things that influence decision making . they can motivate , disinhibit , or destabilize decisions . motivators increase the perceived rewards or benefits of violence . disinhibitors decrease the perceived costs or negative consequences of violence . destabilizers generally disturb or disorganize people ability to monitor and control their decision making . step four : develop scenarios of violence . next , evaluators must make judgments about the examinee potential for violence in light of the presence and relevance of risk factors . simply concluding that an examinee is a  high risk for violence  or has a  fifty four percent chance of violence within ten years  is not sufficient for making any kind of reasonable clinical or even legal decision . instead , evaluators need to consider what kinds of violence the examinee might perpetrate , for which motivations , against which victims , with what kinds of consequences , and at which times . in short , they need to consider scenarios of violence . each scenario is a story about violence the examinee might commit . it is not a prediction about what will happen ; rather , it is a general forecast or speculation about what reasonably could happen , in light of the evaluator general knowledge and experience and the specifics of the case at hand . although the number of possible scenarios that could be constructed is virtually infinite , in any given case only a few distinct scenarios should seem reasonable , credible , or plausible in light of what is known about fact and theory . other scenarios will be perceived as implausible and subsequently dismissed , or  pruned  . the spj approach to developing scenarios of violence was derived from the more general management strategy known as scenario planning , which has been used for more than fifty years in such fields as business , health care , and the military . according to chermack and lynham ,  scenario planning is a process of positing several informed , plausible and imagined alternative future environments in which decisions about the future may be played out , for the purpose of changing current thinking , improving decision making , enhancing human and organization learning and improving performance.  it is most appropriate for situations of complexity and unbounded uncertainty in our view , an accurate characterization of the state of affairs in which many violence risk assessments are conducted . the spj approach encourages evaluators to consider four broad scenarios of violence . the evaluator considers a scenario in which the examinee commits violence similar to his or her most recent act what might be called a repeat ,  flat trajectory ,  linear projection , or point projection scenario . the evaluator considers a scenario in which the trajectory of violence decreases , and the examinee commits a less serious act or even chooses to desist altogether a bestcase or optimistic scenario . the evaluator considers a worstcase scenario , also known as a pessimistic or  doom  scenario , one in which the trajectory increases , and the examinee commits a more serious , and perhaps even lifethreatening , act of violence . the evaluator considers a  twist  or  sideways trajectory  scenario in which the nature of violence changes or evolves , such as with respect to the manner of victim selection or the type of coercion used . multiple scenarios could be developed within each of these four broad categories . then , for each scenario , the evaluator develops a detailed description in terms of the nature , severity , imminence , frequency or duration , and likelihood of violence . finally , the evaluator trims the scenarios that seem implausible based on theory , research , experience , and case facts . in our experience , three to five general scenarios usually are sufficient to capture the range of plausible outcomes in a given case . step five : consider management plans . next , consistent with general principles of scenario planning , evaluators develop case management plans based on plausible scenarios of violence , which in turn were based on the presence and relevance of risk factors . it is common in the spj approach to structure development of plans by considering four general categories of strategies : monitoring , supervision , treatment , and victim safety planning . within each general category of strategies , evaluators identify specific strategies , then translate these into more detailed plans by considering tactics and even logistics . step six : communicate findings . in step six , evaluators should document and communicate their judgments regarding the overall risk in the case . evaluators are encouraged to make judgments concerning such things as case prioritization or overall risk for violence , risk for serious physical harm , any indication of other risks the examinee may pose , any immediate actions taken or required , and critical dates or triggers for case review . it is during this step that evaluators can assign ratings of low , moderate , or high risk the summary risk ratings discussed in detail earlier . these are the key , encapsulating judgments that professionals offer in order to inform risk management . as our research review demonstrated , they are as or more accurate than actuarial estimates . critically , as discussed earlier , the spj approach does not make these judgments using a fixed and explicit algorithm based on some combination of risk factors ; instead , evaluators use their discretion to consider , decide , and explain the relevance or meaningfulness of any factors that are present with respect to the risks posed and management of those risks . also , evaluators are encouraged to limit or qualify their opinions based on the quantity and quality of case information they reviewed . additional considerations . four additional themes consistently emerge from both the literature and court decisions regarding what a reasonably competent assessment of risk entails , once clinicians are aware that there exist reasonable grounds to believe patients may pose a risk for violence . when tarasoff liability has been imposed on clinicians , it has usually been because of the failure of the clinician to abide by one or more of these themes . throughout the process , clinicians should make all reasonable efforts to obtain details of the patient history of violence and response to treatment for violence . for any reasonably comprehensive assessment ,  the painstaking assembling of facts and the checking of information from a variety of sources are essential  . the examinee versions of events should be checked against collateral information , including police and victim versions of events . clinicians must be alert to their own possible tendencies to avoid , deny , or wishfully minimize violent themes and affects . that is , if the possibility of violence risk arises in a clinical context , it must be investigated in a reasonably full and complete manner . in our view , this entails the use of comprehensive violence risk assessment procedures , such as those provided under the spj approach . the use of such an approach minimizes the chances that important risk factors will be overlooked . when patients appear to be at risk for violence , they should be asked if they are thinking of harming anyone and , if so , how they have dealt with such thoughts and feelings in the past . appelbaum and gutheil suggested that it is often useful to ask examinees whether they have ever caused the death or serious injury of another person , even if accidentally . borum , swartz , and swanson suggested :  are you the sort of person who has trouble controlling your temper ?  and  have you found yourself hitting people or damaging things when you are angry ?  . monahan observed : directly asking patients about violent behavior and possible indices of violent behavior is surely the easiest and quickest way to obtain this essential information . openended questions such as  what is the most violent thing you have ever done ?  or  what is the closest you have ever come to being violent ?  may be useful probes , as might  do you ever worry that you might physically hurt somebody ?  the obvious problem , of course , is that patients may lie or distort their history or their current thoughts . . . . quite often , however , patients are remarkably forthcoming about violence . consider the circumstances the examinee may be facing in the future . are these circumstances similar to those that have led to violence in the past ? or are these circumstances that have reduced the risk of violence in the past ? if the examinee will be returning to a less restrictive environment , does he or she demonstrate a meaningful understanding of how to avoid violence in the future ? has the examinee demonstrated a commitment to avoiding violence in the future ? in general , it is worth noting lion observation that an  appearance of tranquility in a violent person can be deceptive . discharging the patient can be an error when the problem has not been really resolved . the clinician must consider whether anything has really changed.  when in doubt , consult . indeed , when and where feasible , even when not in doubt , consult . simply put , it is both ethically and legally advisable to obtain a second , knowledgeable opinion about what to do when one is uncertain whether a patient poses a serious risk of causing serious harm to another person or persons . we make the next additional recommendations that are useful to consider in fulfilling the demands of comprehensive risk assessments that are ethically and legally defensible . as the violent history of the examinee becomes more distant in time , more effort may be required to accurately reconstruct the details , but such efforts should be made . at the same time , all potential sources of information regarding the examinee former violence , current behavior , and mental status should be considered . in institutional contexts , it is generally sensible to have patients assessed by clinicians who are not attached to the patient treatment and care before final decisions or recommendations are made . this recommendation offered to facilitate objectivity in assessment is consistent with ethical guidelines for mental health professionals . treating clinicians , and ward staff in general , may become so invested in believing that particular patients under their care have made adequate progress , or may so want to avoid disrupting the relative equilibrium achieved by a formerly more disorganized patient , or may so want to support the aspirations of a wellliked patient , that they avoid seeing negative signs and confronting the patient with difficult but necessary questions . conversely , a patient who is uncooperative or challenging toward staff on the ward may be viewed as more dangerous than he or she really is . therefore , except in obvious cases , a more detached evaluator may be called for . when inpatients pose a risk of serious violence , recommendations for release should not be made without subjecting the patient to stressful questions regarding the sources of his or her previous violence and what the patient needs to do to avoid violence in the future . as borum et al . observed : many potentially violent patients can and will appear calm and nonthreatening when not challenged , frustrated , or irritated . the clinician needs to be able to gingerly increase the frustration or challenge in the interview to test the frustration tolerance and impulse control of the patient without precipitating a dangerous outburst . a highly structured , unchallenging interview can dull the examiner into underestimating the violent potential of the patient . in certain circumstances , with certain patients , we would make the point even more strongly : sometimes it is precisely the question or challenge that will precipitate a  dangerous outburst  that must be posed . indeed , sometimes the clinician inner sense that certain areas should be avoided lest the patient become overly disturbed is the best guide to determining what areas require further exploration . of course , there is no legitimate reason to provoke a patient needlessly . thus , there may be no reason to subject a patient to a stressful interview if it is clear from other information that less secure supervision is not in order in any event . but when a patient with a history of serious violence is being considered for transfer to a less secure setting , it is hard to imagine concluding that transfer is in order without at least determining how the patient reacts to stressful questions regarding the circumstances he or she is likely to face in a new setting . even when stressful questions are indicated , clinicians should be careful not to be excessively , or needlessly , aggressive in their manner or confrontations . and clinicians should take reasonable steps to calm a disturbed patient once a stressful interview has ended . in any event , however , in order to pose suitably stressful questions to the patient , the assessor must be knowledgeable beforehand about the particular vulnerabilities of the patient . that is , in order to conduct an adequate stress interview , the clinician must first thoroughly inform him or herself about what has led to and triggered violence or regressions in the patient in the past . indeed , it can not be overly stressed that comprehensive risk assessments can be accomplished only if the assessor is first well versed about the examinee history . it has often been said of legal trial practice that preparation is the key to crossexamination . equally so , preparation is the key to a fully comprehensive risk assessment . a number of commentators have suggested that assessments of violence risk can be improved if assessors avoid making errors that have frequently been observed to pertain to dangerousness evaluations . among the relevant recommendations are that the clinicians should : recognize their own legitimate doubts and legitimate disagreements between evaluators and among staff regarding an examinee risk level to avoid unjustifiably confident determinations of dangerousness in either direction . clinicians should avoid a judgmental perspective or aligning themselves too much with the patient wishes and desires . they should be open to information that contradicts their initial , or even stated , opinion . indeed , as appelbaum and gutheil stressed , it may be useful in many forensic evaluations for clinicians to imagine that they were retained as an expert by the  other side  of the case , and to imagine how their evaluation or conclusions might be different if that were so . be careful not to underestimate the potential for violence in female patients who have a history of violence . it is true that , on the whole in our society , women have a much lower rate of violence than men , yet research indicates that women who evidence risk factors for violence are about as likely as men to commit violence and that , relative to their estimations regarding men , clinicians tend to underestimate the risk of future violence with women . with these guidelines and recommendations in mind , we now turn to a discussion of how violence risk assessment has fared in the courts . violence risk assessments and the law . in this section , we review certain important legal developments concerning assessments of dangerousness by mental health professionals . assessments of dangerousness and the supreme court . despite qualms expressed by various professional organizations and legal commentators , and some of their own brethren , the supreme court of the united states has been receptive to assessments of dangerousness and risk by mental health professionals in a variety of circumstances . most notable perhaps , in barefoot v. estelle , by a six vote , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a sentence of death that was based in part on the prediction of a testifying psychiatrist that the  probability  that the defendant would commit additional crimes of violence in prison if not executed was  one hundred percent and absolute  . although not unmindful of the questions that existed regarding the validity of predictions of violence by mental health professionals , in barefoot , the majority opined that such questions could adequately be dealt with by the trier of fact ,  we are not persuaded ,  stated the court ,  that such testimony is almost entirely unreliable and that the factfinder and the adversary system will not be competent to uncover , recognize and take due account of its shortcomings  . in schall v. martin , the supreme court observed that  from a legal point of view there is nothing inherently unattainable about a prediction of future criminal conduct  and that the lower court had  specifically rejected the contention , based on . . . sociological data . . . , ‘ that it is impossible to predict future violent behavior ’  . more recently , u.s. supreme court justice stevens reasoned in his dissent in united states v. scheffer that  here is no legal requirement that expert testimony must satisfy a particular degree of reliability to be admissible . expert testimony about a defendant ‘ future dangerousness ’ to determine his eligibility for the death penalty , even if wrong ‘ most of the time , ’ is routinely admitted  . similarly , in kansas v. hendricks and kansas v. crane , the court voiced approval of risk assessment in the sexual predator context . in hendricks , the supreme court determined the constitutionality of a sexually violent predator statute , permitting the postincarceration civil commitment of sex offenders . the intent of the statute was to civilly detain people who presented a risk to public safety due to tendencies to perpetrate sexual violence . as with other types of civil commitment , a determination of future dangerousness was required by the statute . future dangerousness could be determined by past sexually violent behavior , such as the crime for which the individual was incarcerated , and a connection between that behavior and a mental  abnormality  reducing the individual control over the dangerous behavior . the supreme court determined that postconviction civil commitment in this manner did not violate substantive due process rights under the constitution . in kansas v. crane , the court further interpreted this statute and held that the lack of control over the sexually violent behavior did not have to be absolute . in its reasoning , the court continued to demonstrate amenability toward risk assessment and a reliance on mental health professionals in stating that the lack of behavioral control ,  when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis and the severity of the mental abnormality itself , must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness , abnormality , or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case  . recent developments concerning the admissibility of testimony about violence risk . our own survey of state and federal cases considering the admissibility of expert testimony on risk assessment reveals that it is rarely excluded . testimony on risk assessment can be based on clinical interviewing techniques , reliance on results from actuarial instruments , or a combination of these techniques . clinical assessments of dangerousness have long been admissible under the frye test , which still prevails in many states and which allows for expert testimony regarding the results of professional procedures when those procedures have gained  general acceptance  in their field . moreover , little has changed in the federal courts since frye was supplanted by daubert . when testimony is based on the results of a clinical interview alone , courts typically admit the testimony , stating that clinical interviewing techniques are generally accepted . however , some courts have determined that reliance only on a clinical interview and failure to use actuarial instruments renders expert testimony unreliable . when the testimony is based in part on the results of actuarial instruments , typically it is also admitted . many courts have indicated that testimony based in part on actuarial instruments is admissible because it is combined with clinical opinion . courts have not specifically stated that testimony based solely on the results of actuarial instruments would be excluded . however , this has been implied by court arguments that the testimony is admissible only because combined with clinical judgment . for example , one court stated : by this ruling , we are not concluding that actuarial risk assessment instruments are reliable per se or have our approval when used alone and not in conjunction with a full clinical evaluation . we note this was not the situation or issue presented in the instant case . the instruments were used in conjunction with a full clinical evaluation and their limitations were clearly made known to the jury . regardless of the basis for the testimony , courts have rarely given substantive consideration to the reliability of risk assessment in their admission decisions , even after the daubert and kumho tire opinions . in their assessment of reliability , courts have taken several approaches . typically , courts argue that a frye or daubert evaluation of the evidence is inappropriate . many courts draw a distinction between clinical observations , which have a medical basis , and the use of actuarial instruments , which have a scientific basis . when this distinction is made , it is reasoned that a reliability analysis does not apply to the clinical observations because they are not scientific or novel , they are based on standard psychological analysis of behavioral observations , and they are based on experience . courts are more likely to subject actuarial tools to frye or daubert analyses , but the application of these standards to actuarial instruments varies across jurisdictions . as noted , some courts have argued that frye and daubert do not apply to the scientifically based actuarial instruments when they are combined with clinical interviewing , but that they would be if presented alone . they reason that the instruments do not act as a source of  infallible truth  or  scientific infallibility  when combined with clinical judgment . other courts have argued that a frye or daubert analysis must be conducted when any part of the testimony is based on the actuarial instruments because they are scientific . these courts have largely determined that the use of actuarial instruments in risk assessment is generally accepted and reliable , and the testimony is admitted . some courts have pronounced the instruments generally accepted and their results admissible even without a frye hearing . regarding the actuarial instruments , one court concluded that they were  at least as good , if not in most cases better , in terms of reliability and predictability than clinical interviews  . some courts that previously determined that testimony based on actuarial instruments was inadmissible because the tools were not generally accepted were later overruled by courts finding that they are generally accepted . however , some courts continue to reason that actuarial instruments are irrelevant and speculative in demonstrating lack of propensity for future risk of violence . other courts concluding that testimony based on actuarial instruments satisfies frye when used to predict recidivism require frye hearings when these tools are used for other purposes , such as demonstrating the existence of a mental illness . most of these decisions have arisen from frye jurisdictions , but reasoning about these cases in daubert jurisdictions does not differ substantially . the daubert factors are rarely applied to this type of testimony or are applied loosely . finally , many courts decline to assess reliability for the purpose of admission decisions , reasoning that questions of reliability go to the weight , not to the admissibility , of the evidence , or have determined that frye and daubert do not apply to the legal context of the case , such as sentencing . in short , whether in frye or in daubert jurisdictions , courts have been receptive to violence risk assessments , whether clinical or actuarial , by mental health professionals . civil commitment decisions . in addington v. texas , the u.s. supreme court ruled that individuals could be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for an extended period of time only if there was  clear and convincing evidence  that they met a legitimate legal standard for confinement . therefore , to the extent that dangerousness as well as mental illness is required by law to justify an extended commitment , addington requires that such dangerousness be proven by  clear and convincing evidence  . the court in addington also observed ,  whether the individual is mentally ill and dangerous to either himself or others and is in need of confined therapy turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists  . there are two points to note about the addington decision . first , it applied only to extended confinements . therefore , presumably , less than  clear and convincing evidence  of mental illness and dangerousness could justify a relatively brief commitment for the purpose of further evaluation . second , it is important to recognize that the requirement of  clear and convincing evidence  of dangerousness , when it exists , is not a requirement of proof that the individual is more likely than not to be violent if not hospitalized . rather , it is a requirement for  clear and convincing evidence  of enough risk of enough harm to justify the confinement at issue . indeed , in a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety decision , the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled that  a finding of ‘ substantial risk ’ may be based on any activity that evinces a genuine possibility of future harm to persons or property  . and the court also rejected the notion that , to be constitutional , a civil commitment must be based on a recent overt act or threat of violence . rather , the court stated ,  whether activity occurred recently is but one factor . . . to consider in weighing the evidence  . the decision in the sahhar case is emblematic of a recent trend away from the strict standards for civil commitments that were established in some jurisdictions in the nineteen seventies to more flexible criteria . this trend can best be appreciated by comparing more recent decisions with the rulings in lessard v. schmidt , an oftencited federal court decision of a generation ago that strictly limited the government power to civilly commit mentally ill individuals . in lessard , the court ruled that a commitment could be justified only by proof of  an extreme likelihood that if the person is not confined he will do immediate harm to himself or others  . moreover , the lessard court held that the necessary determination of dangerousness had to be  based upon a finding of a recent overt act , attempt , or threat to do substantial harm to oneself or another  . in addition to rejecting the notion that violence must be likely or based on a recent overt act or threat in order to justify a commitment , other court decisions have rejected the notion that future dangerousness must be  imminent  to justify confinement . for example , in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety one , the supreme court of massachusetts held that  to the degree that the anticipated harm is serious . . . some lessening of a requirement of imminence seems justified  ; and in seltzer v. hogue , a new york state appellate court upheld the continued confinement of a mentally ill person who in the past had  invariably  become violent following his release from hospitalization , even though he had not been  imminently  violent upon release . thus , as one of us has written elsewhere : it appears that as the earlier abuses of the civil commitment system are supplanted in judicial and public concern by concern about potential violence by mentally ill persons who perhaps could not be committed under a strict reading of earlier and more libertarian oriented decisions , the judicial pendulum is swinging toward a greater willingness to allow civil commitments to protect the public from potential danger , and to allow that danger to be assessed broadly , rather than by rigid , impractical rules . moreover , it should be pointed out , the u.s. supreme court has ruled that insanity acquittees may be required to prove that they are no longer dangerous before being released from confinement . and in the case of in the matter of george l. , the new york court of appeals approvingly quoted from an earlier decision regarding insanity acquittees that  compliance or lack of dangerousness in a facility does not necessarily mean that an individual does not suffer from a dangerous mental disorder  . even more recently , regarding the retention of insanity acquittees , the new york court of appeals opined : in addition to recent acts of violence . . . a court may consider the nature of the conduct that resulted in the initial commitment , the likelihood of relapse or cure , history of substance or alcohol abuse , the effects of medication , the likelihood that the patient will discontinue medication without supervision , the length of confinement and treatment , the lapse of time since the underlying criminal acts and any other relevant factors that form a part of an insanity acquittee psychological profile . of course , it is ultimately for the courts , rather than clinicians , to decide when mentally disordered individuals pose a sufficient risk of causing significant harm to justify depriving them of their liberty . but emergency room clinicians must make such decisions regarding emergency admissions , and judges frequently look to clinicians for their input and insights before making their decisions . therefore , before clinicians deem a patient to be dangerous for commitment purposes , they should be mindful of the fact that they are , indeed , making a risk assessment and that , just as a sufficient risk of future violence may justify a patient confinement , so , too , a patient right to liberty should be weighed in the balance.. the case law , research , and voluminous commentary that have followed from the tarasoff decision can not be reviewed here ; nor can the various laws and professional regulations defining tarasofflike duties that have been adopted in many states , or the differing responsibilities held by inpatient and outpatient clinicians . for examples , see binder and mcniel ; emmerich v. philadelphia center for human development ; fraser v. u.s. ; and n.j. stat . twenty one . for recent commentary , see bersoff ; borum and reddy ; buckner and firestone ; felthous and kachigian ; gutheil and brodsky ; pinta ; simone and fulero ; tolman ; vandecreek and knapp ; walcott et al . ; and werth , welfel , and benjamin . suffice it to say for the purposes of this chapter that clearly one component of the duty to protect is the duty to conduct a professionally adequate risk assessment when such an assessment is called for . the field of violence risk assessment has made considerable strides in recent years . indeed , since the publication of the previous version of this chapter , several hundred empirical studies have been published on violence risk assessment instruments . we have indeed made progress in terms of understanding how to develop and validate risk assessment instruments and how instruments from different families fare relative to one another . perhaps one of the biggest developments is that , contrary to previous opinion , clinical judgments of risk so long as they are derived in a structured context , such as that provided by the spj model are as or more accurate compared to actuarial predictions of violence . this is a major and liberating finding that can facilitate focus on other important topics within risk assessment . for instance , there has been great conceptual progress on the process of risk assessment at the individual case level this topic would benefit greatly from a comparable amount of empirical attention . for instance , how do clinicians decide which risk factors are most relevant in a given case ? how do they integrate this information into formulations ? does this improve the quality of risk management ? the risk assessment field could benefit from turning its attention to several other areas of focus in the future . first , although commentators have been stressing the importance of dynamic risk for some time , the empirical evaluation of changes in risk factors over time lags . this is understandable it is hard research to conduct . yet many questions remain : which factors change ? what is the nature of change ? does change relate to changes in violence ? can we impact change deliberately ? for which risk factors ? sustained attention to dynamic risk will allow the field to continue to move toward a risk reduction or risk management focus . that is , studies of whether risk assessment instruments can be used to assign persons to treatment intensities , with specified relevant risk factors , are necessary . there is evidence from the correctional field that such a focus could indeed reduce violence . there has been a movement over the past decade or so to increase the focus on protective factors . as yet , the field of forensic mental health has not come to terms with the conceptual nature of protective factors and how they interact with risk factors . are they distinct from risk factors ? or are they the opposite pole of risk factors ? are they relevant in the absence of risk factors , or only when risk factors are present ? regardless of the answer to these important conceptual questions , it is clear that important strides are under way to understand the role that focusing on positive aspects of our clients ’ lives might have . for example , several assessment instruments focus on positive aspects of clients . the start requires ratings of patient strengths along with vulnerabilities . the savry contains a subscale devoted to protective factors . the saprof is devoted entirely to protective factors and is intended to be used in conjunction with an spj risk assessment instrument such as the twentyr20 . empirical support for the utility of each of these measures is accruing , and we encourage the continued attention to this topic . although hardly a new concern , we advocate continued efforts to test and ensure that risk assessment instruments can be used ethically with persons of all ethnic backgrounds , whether male or female , and regardless of sexual orientation . evidence drawn from metaanalyses suggests that it is unlikely that there are major problems in this regard . some concerns were evident in the findings reported by singh et al . . further , it is important to understand whether , even if a risk assessment instrument predicts violence comparably well across , say , men and women , its risk factors have comparable meaning or relevance across gender . to some extent , this question can be integrated into the formulation stage of clinical assessment , where clinicians are grappling with making sense of the meaning of certain risk factors for individuals . continued work on this topic is necessary . finally , we think it is important that researchers expand their topics beyond those concerning the predictive accuracy of instruments . assessing and improving predictive accuracy is crucial , to be sure . however , as described earlier concerning the process of risk assessment , there are other important topics to understand . one such topic is related to both assessing and improving predictive validity : to what extent might postrelease intervention or management moderate , and possibly improve , predictive accuracy ? we want our assessments to influence practice and reduce risk . however , if we study accuracy issues within realworld settings , where risk assessments may influence interventions , those interventions interfere with the outcomes that we are interested in . hence , research should attempt to build expected treatment or intervention dosage into predictive models . one such example was recently provided by belfrage et al . , who demonstrated that persons judged to be higher risk on the sara by police , who also received higher doses of risk management , were less likely to recidivate in the future relative to highrisk persons who received lower doses of management . although great strides have been made in the risk assessment field , it is clear that much important work remains .
