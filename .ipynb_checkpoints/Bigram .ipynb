       " 'this specialty area has continued to grow rapidly since the previous edition of the handbook of forensic psychology was published in two thousand and six , with increasing numbers of psychologists becoming involved in forensic practice and research and a steady flow of new ideas and information becoming available .',\n",
       " 'chapters nineteen and twenty then provide accounts of the development of lie detection and hypnosis and describe current and emerging trends in forensic uses of these procedures .',\n",

       " 'finally , the appendix provides readers with the full text of the specialty guidelines for forensic psychology .',\n",
       " 'we would like to thank our authors for their valuable contributions to this volume , both those who revised chapters that appeared in previous editions and those who joined us for the first time in this edition .',\n",
       " 'we also want to acknowledge with appreciation the guidance and support of the john wiley and sons editorial staff , particularly patricia rossi , executive editor and kara borbely , editorial program coordinator .',\n",

       " 'readers familiar with previous editions of the handbook will recognize his fingerprints on this edition as well .',\n",
       " 'in the course of writing this chapter over four editions of this handbook , we have learned a few lessons .',\n",
       " 'in the first edition , we asserted that psychologists do not care about the history of their profession but are instead drawn to contemporary issues and theories .',\n",
       " 'we learned that this was a simplistic generalization , so in subsequent editions we acknowledged that our initial statement had been rash .',\n",
       " 'psychologists do care about history , as is apparent from numerous articles published in professional journals reviewing historical trends , the continuing publication of a journal devoted to the history of psychology , and special interest divisions of professional organizations , such as division twenty six , society for the history of psychology , of the american psychological association .',\n",
       " 'we have also learned that there is some danger in proclaiming an event or a person a historic first or a father , because these proclamations may be challenged , usually with kindness but not always with good humor .',\n",
       " 'psychology , like other disciplines , needs historical insights .',\n",
       " 'it needs to understand whence',\n",
       " 'it came in order to assess where it is going .',\n",
       " 'a perusal of journals and books published at the turn of the twentieth century , for example , may spark interest in a concept long forgotten or a predecessor whose theories and research deserve to be revisited .',\n",
       " 'yet delving into early works reminds us of false starts and the occasional damage they did , such as the work of henry goddard on feeblemindedness during the early nineteeth and the self promotion of hugo munsterberg .',\n",
       " 'however , we have also learned that hindsight is imperfect ; people are sometimes overlooked , and the historical discoveries may be incomplete .',\n",
       " 'we thus approach this chapter once again with humility .',\n",
       " 'to paraphrase the phrase that journalism is the first rough draft of history , we say here that this chapter is our fourth rough draft of the history of forensic psychology , with emphasis on its american origins .',\n",
       " 'in these early years of the twenty first century , forensic psychology remains a young branch of applied psychology , having been recognized by the apa as a specialty in two thousand and one and recertified in two thousand and eight .',\n",
       " 'even before that , in nineteen ninety one , specialty guidelines for forensic psychologists were adopted by the american psychology law society , which is division forty one of the apa .',\n",
       " 'these guidelines were recently revised , renamed specialty guidelines for forensic psychology , and accepted by the apa council of representatives .',\n",
       " 'interestingly , although forensic psychology was initially viewed as primarily clinical in nature such as by providing assessments to the courts its scope has broadened to encompass the practice of psychology as it provides expertise to the law in a very wide range of contexts .',\n",
       " 'this broad view of forensic psychology was not always supported .',\n",
       " 'according to ronald roesch , for example , most psychologists define the area more narrowly to refer to clinical psychologists who are engaged in clinical practice within the legal system .',\n",
       " 'a few years later , brigham and grisso modified this somewhat , noting many psychologists define forensic psychology more narrowly to refer to clinical psychologists who are engaged in clinical practice within the legal system .',\n",
       " 'the distinction here is between psychologists who bring scientific information to the courts for their consideration in cases and psychologists who evaluate individuals and testify about them in reference to a legal question .',\n",
       " 'in recognizing forensic psychology as a specialty in two thousand and one , the apa itself adopted the narrow approach , to include the primarily clinical aspects of forensic assessment , treatment , and consultation .',\n",
       " 'however , as noted , the specialty guidelines take a broader view .',\n",
       " 'in this chapter , forensic psychology is being viewed broadly .',\n",
       " 'it is both the research endeavor that examines aspects of human behavior directly related to the legal process and the professional practice of psychology within or in consultation with a legal system that encompasses both criminal and civil law and the numerous areas where they intersect .',\n",
       " 'therefore , the term forensic psychology refers broadly to the production of psychological knowledge and its application to the civil and criminal justice systems .',\n",
       " 'it includes activities as varied as these : courtroom testimony , child custody evaluations , law enforcement candidate screening , treatment of offenders in correctional facilities , assessment of plaintiffs with disability claims , research and theory building in the area of criminal behavior , and the design and implementation of intervention and prevention programs for youthful offenders .',\n",
       " 'a review of the table of contents of this handbook indicates a similarly broad focus .',\n",
       " 'in the pages to follow , after an introductory section covering seminal contributions , we review developments in four major areas of forensic psychology : legal psychology , correctional psychology , police psychology , and criminal psychology .',\n",
       " 'readers will undoubtedly recognize that there is considerable overlap in these categories and in the subheadings .',\n",
       " 'the jury , or at least the judge , should know how far errors in recollection are normal and how they vary under different conditions .',\n",
       " 'but cattell himself was surprised at both the degree of inaccuracy he uncovered and the wide range of individual differences in the levels of confidence expressed by the students .',\n",
       " 'answers to the weather question , for example , were equally distributed over all kinds of weather which are possible at the beginning of march .',\n",
       " 'some students were nearly always sure they were correct , even when they were not , while others were consistently uncertain and hesitant in their answers , even when they were correct .',\n",
       " 'cattell study probably was the genesis of modern forensic psychology in the united states , because it sparked the interest of other researchers in the psychology of testimony , which remains to this day a dominant research interest among legal psychologists .',\n",
       " 'joseph jastrow immediately replicated cattell experiment at the university of wisconsin and obtained similar results .',\n",
       " 'aside from this brief flirtation , however , american psychologists did not immediately embrace the study of legal issues .',\n",
       " 'psychologists in europe seemed more intrigued they had long been interested in the psychological concepts involved .',\n",
       " 'moreover , the researchers found that inaccuracies increased with respect to the second half of the scenario , when excitement and tension were at their peak .',\n",
       " 'they concluded tentatively that affective reactions inhibit exact observation and reliable remembrance .',\n",
       " 'by his own account , stern was more interested in basic research than its application .',\n",
       " 'indeed , when i began in nineteen one to examine the correctness of recollection among my students , i was determined by theoretical interests in the realm of memory rather than by any practical considerations .',\n",
       " 'yet once confronted with the results , i realized the importance of this research beyond the borders of mere academic psychology .',\n",
       " 'throughout that first decade of the twentieth century , stern was an active researcher in the psychology of testimony .',\n",
       " 'he also helped establish and edited the first journal on the psychology of testimony , betrage zur psychologie der aussage , which was published in leipzig .',\n",
       " 'the journal was superseded in nineteen seven by the much broader zeitschrift fur angewande psychologie , edited by stern and his colleague otto lipmann .',\n",
       " 'in a cautionary note about his research , stern stressed that most witnesses did not intentionally falsify their reports .',\n",
       " 'rather , the subtle and common problem created was one of unintentional falsification : subjective sincerity does not guarantee objective truthfulness , he wrote .',\n",
       " 'in his research , stern concluded among other things that : leading and suggestive questions contaminate the accuracy of eyewitness accounts of critical events ; there are important differences between adult and child witnesses ; lineups are of limited value when the members are not matched for age and physical appearance ; and interceding events between an initial event and its recall can have drastic effects on memory .',\n",
       " 'therefore , modern forensic psychology began as legal psychology with empirical research on the psychology of testimony .',\n",
       " 'wundt , a philosopher and an experimentalist , was wary of applying psychology until sufficient research had been conducted .',\n",
       " 'he believed that the premature use of partial information could be disastrous .',\n",
       " 'his students often took this caveat quite seriously , although some , like cattell , eventually began to link the laboratory to the world outside .',\n",
       " 'munsterberg , always willing to give speeches , gave his inaugural lecture at radcliffe college in eighteen ninety four and his last at the same location in nineteen sixteen , when he suddenly died of a heart attack midsentence while lecturing his general psychology class .',\n",
       " 'landy wrote that at the time of his death .',\n",
       " 'munsterberg was an object of public scorn and was well on the way to professional ostracism .',\n",
       " 'by nineteen nineteen , less than three years after his death , there was hardly any reference to any of his more than ten books and dozens of articles in basic and applied psychology .',\n",
       " 'benjamin noted that munsterberg was one of the most despised individuals in america .',\n",
       " 'interestingly , in a recent article , sporer correctly pointed out that much valuable information about early contributions of other individuals in legal psychology has been lost because of excessive focus on munsterberg .',\n",
       " 'bornstein and penrod admirably compared the value of these respective texts , noting that arnold , even though he was not an academician , displayed an impressive familiarity with the psychological literature of the day .',\n",
       " 'they noted also that his style was dry and reads like the serious academic tome that it is , whereas munsterberg style was directed at a general , less serious audience .',\n",
       " 'bornstein and penrod are to be commended for bringing attention to this obscure work , but the fact remains that arnold overall contributions were not as far reaching as those of munsterberg .',\n",
       " 'the following year , he became a research assistant .',\n",
       " 'in nineteen twenty nine , he was appointed associate professor , teaching a course in the psychology of evidence , which appears to qualify him as the first psychologist granted faculty status in an american law school .',\n",
       " 'in nineteen thirty , slesinger followed hutchins to the university of chicago , where he served as professor of law and , briefly , as dean of the law school .',\n",
       " 'several years earlier , psychologist william marston had been the first to receive a faculty appointment as professor of legal psychology when he joined the faculty at american university in nineteen twenty two .',\n",
       " 'marston was by far the most influential psychologist associated with the legal system during this era .',\n",
       " 'he was a student of munsterberg but did not have his mentor penchant for alienating the legal community and much of the american public .',\n",
       " 'it is likely , therefore , that marston along with lewis terman and psychologists associated with the new york city psychopathic clinic qualifies as one of the first psychological consultants to the criminal justice system in the united states .',\n",

       " 'definitions range from expansive ones that include any application of psychology to any legal matters to those that are narrower and typically are limited to clinical and counseling psychologists involvement in legal matters as examiners , treatment providers , or consultants .',\n",
       " 'examples of more expansive definitions include those offered by huss , who defined forensic psychology as any application of psychology to the legal system ; the american psychological association , which in its specialty guidelines for forensic psychology indicated that forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any subdiscipline of psychology when applying the scientific , technical , or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal , contractual , and administrative matters ; and the american board of forensic psychology , which described forensic psychology as the application of the science and profession of psychology to questions and issues relating to law and the legal system .',\n",
       " 'in contrast , in its petition to the apa committee for the recognition of specialties and proficiencies in professional psychology to establish forensic psychology as a psychological specialty , the forensic specialty council offered a more narrow definition : forensic psychology is the professional practice by psychologists within the areas of clinical psychology , counseling psychology , school psychology or another specialty recognized by the american psychological association , when they are engaged as experts and represent themselves as such , in an activity primarily intended to provide professional psychological expertise to the judicial system .',\n",

       " 'the emphasis in law is stare decisis , whereas in psychology the emphasis is on creativity .',\n",
       " 'law is hierarchical whereas psychology is empirical .',\n",
       " 'decisions within the legal system are hierarchically based and authoritative , with lower courts bound by the decisions of higher courts .',\n",
       " 'in psychology , however , it is the accumulation of a body of consistent and supporting data that confirms the validity of a particular position or claim , not its authoritative declaration .',\n",
       " 'although this is not to say that bias does not enter into the research process , the goal of the psychologist is to attain an objective understanding of the phenomena rather than victory over a particular viewpoint .',\n",
       " 'law is prescriptive , whereas psychology is descriptive .',\n",
       " 'the law is primarily prescriptive , telling people how they should behave , whereas psychology is essentially a descriptive discipline , seeking to describe behavior as it actually occurs .',\n",
       " 'this dimension captures a difference in the values espoused in the disciplines , with law outlining how one ought to behave and psychology adopting a more nonjudgmental orientation of how people do behave .',\n",
       " 'decision making in law is based on the appearance of certainty , whereas decision making in psychology is based on probabilistic evidence .',\n",
       " 'the decisions made in the law typically take on a dichotomous , all or nothing quality the accused in a criminal trial is deemed either guilty or not guilty , the defendant in a civil case is found liable or not liable .',\n",
       " 'psychologists , in contrast , operate in terms of probabilities ; for example , claims are asserted on the basis of evidence associated with a probability level .',\n",
       " 'as a result , conclusions drawn by psychologists typically are qualified and not categorical by nature .',\n",
       " 'psychologists assisting the legal system .',\n",
       " 'psychologists assist the legal system in a number of ways including providing expert testimony in legal , administrative , and legislative proceedings ; conducting and testifying about research conducted in anticipation of litigation ; testifying about research not conducted in connection with litigation',\n",
       " 'but that is nonetheless relevant ; and researching the legal system operation .',\n",
       " 'every day in the united states and other countries , thousands of psychologists appear before and provide expert opinions to courts , administrative proceedings , attorneys , and legislative hearings via reports and sworn testimony .',\n",
       " 'indeed , federal rule of evidence seven hundred and two makes clear under what circumstances psychologists are permitted to testify : a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge , skill , experience , training , or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if : the expert scientific , technical , or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue ; the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data ; the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods ; and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case .',\n",
       " 'in these cases , psychologists are offering observations and opinions about a specific person who has been evaluated , and these observations and opinions are considered helpful to the court .',\n",
       " 'in all of these cases , psychologists assess individuals in light of the parameters the law has established for the particular question being addressed in order to gather data and offer opinions that will be presented to the decision makers to assist them in reaching a more informed decision in the matter .',\n",
       " 'in some cases , psychologists can be of assistance to attorneys and the court by conducting and presenting the results of research that addresses important points of contention in litigation .',\n",
       " 'although the kind of questions that are asked and the type of research that is conducted can vary dramatically , common to this work is that the research was conducted in the context of the litigation at hand and designed to answer some casespecific questions.in their influential treatise , walker and monahan described the products of this research as social fact testimony .',\n",
       " 'for example , often in dispute in patent and trademark litigation is the issue of consumer confusion about competing products .',\n",
       " 'in support of its claim , zippo presented results of research conducted expressly for purposes of the litigation , in which participants who were presented with both lighters demonstrated confusion about the brands .',\n",
       " 'the results and interpretation of these data were offered by zippo manufacturing in support of its ultimately successful claim that consumer confusion resulted from the trademarked design similarities .',\n",
       " 'psychologists also conduct research to inform legal decision makers about the knowledge and attitudes members of a jury pool have about a case that is about to go to trial , so as to inform decisions about whether an unbiased jury can be empaneled or whether a change in venue is necessary .',\n",
       " 'such jury venire research , which is conducted in both criminal and civil proceedings , involves developing and administering surveys that query potential members of the jury pool about their knowledge and attitudes concerning the case at hand .',\n",
       " 'psychologists who conduct this research may be called to testify about their findings , thereby providing the court with information about the jury pool that it would not otherwise have , to allow it to make a more informed decision about potential jurors knowledge of case matters and the potential need for a change in venue .',\n",
       " 'for example , a psychologist knowledgeable about research regarding eyewitnesses might be called to testify and educate a jury in a criminal proceeding about the poor relationship between eyewitness confidence and eyewitness accuracy , or how crime witnesses tend to focus on weapons that are brandished and pay less attention to the perpetrator and his or her appearance .',\n",
       " 'or , in a child abuse prosecution , a psychologist knowledgeable about sexual victimization of children might educate the jury about why child victims of sexual abuse do not always come forward immediately to report the abuse or identify the perpetrator .',\n",
       " 'social authority testimony is also introduced in legislative hearings , to inform lawmakers about psychological phenomena that are relevant to pending legislation .',\n",
       " 'psychologists conduct research that examines the legal system and its operation , and their findings can provide direction that is of considerable value .',\n",
       " 'this research is quite varied in nature and focuses on phenomena as disparate as the effectiveness of various legal interventions or programs , the prevalence and characteristics of various phenomena , and the operation of the legal system more generally .',\n",
       " 'what unifies this type of research is its focus on understanding and improving the legal system and its potential to provide important information to those who fashion policy and make laws that shape the legal system and its operation.as an example , in their program of research , redlich and her colleagues have examined the outcomes associated with special mental health courts designed to respond to criminal defendants whose involvement with the criminal justice system is related to their problems with severe and persistent mental illness .',\n",
       " 'peters and his colleagues , in a similar line of research , examined the efficacy of courts devoted to managing the special challenges of offenders with substance abuse problems .',\n",
       " 'common to their involvement in all matters , however , is the fact that psychologists are relying on their expertise to provide helpful information that would otherwise not be available to legal decision makers .',\n",
       " 'we turn next to a discussion of the role that forensic psychologists play in assisting specific legal actors .',\n",
       " 'given that forensic psychology involves the application of psychology to the legal system , it is not surprising that much of the work of forensic psychologists involves assisting specific legal actors .',\n",
       " 'in this section , we discuss the different ways in which forensic psychologists may assist law enforcement agencies , attorneys , litigants and others .',\n",
       " 'within the area of policing and law enforcement , psychologists may play a variety of roles .',\n",
       " 'at the level of investigation , a number of popular books , television shows and movies depict criminal profilers .',\n",
       " 'james brussel , a psychiatrist who began consulting to the new york city police department in the nineteen fifties , described the first case in which he was asked to assist the police .',\n",
       " 'the mad bomber of new york detonated more than twenty bombs in theaters , transportation terminals , libraries , and offices around new york city for sixteen years during the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties .',\n",
       " 'despite notes and letters mailed to them by the bomber , the police were at a loss to identify a suspect and eventually consulted brussel , who examined the evidence the police had collected , including the notes , letters , and photographs and details of the crime scenes .',\n",
       " 'brussel developed a precise criminal profile of the bomber , which turned out to closely match the characteristics of the man the police eventually apprehended and prosecuted .',\n",
       " 'since that time , the field of criminal profiling has developed .',\n",
       " 'of course , in many cases , the efforts of psychologists and psychiatrists have not been so successful , and there remains concern that criminal profiling is nothing more than socalled smoke and mirrors .',\n",
       " 'in reality , most criminal profilers are police officers , but forensic psychologists sometimes are called on to assist with investigations .',\n",
       " 'over time , investigative psychology and offender profiling have developed into an area of forensic psychology with an empirical base , and modern approaches to offender profiling are far removed from the early speculative approaches that are still so often depicted in television and film .',\n",
       " 'psychologists have also conducted research to investigate the efficacy of police interviews and assist police with interviewing witnesses and suspects , including child victims and witnesses .',\n",
       " 'this work assists police in developing interviewing skills for use with witnesses and suspects that will maximize the amount of accurate information that is obtained and minimize bias and error .',\n",
       " 'in addition to direct involvement with police with respect to conducting investigations and questioning witnesses and suspects , psychologists are involved in a range of other activities .',\n",
       " 'psychologists may be called on to assist the police in their interactions with persons with mental disorders .',\n",
       " 'a great deal of work has also been done to assist law enforcement agencies with respect to screening , selection , and recruitment of police candidates and providing critical mental health services to sworn officers and their families .',\n",
       " 'we now turn to a brief review of the roles psychologists play in assisting attorneys .',\n",
       " 'psychologists frequently provide consultation to attorneys with respect to case formulation and jury matters .',\n",
       " 'to this end , some psychologists assist attorneys in conceptualizing and presenting cases in a way that will be most advantageous to their clients .',\n",
       " 'moreover , a growing area of study focuses on the psychology of the jury , in which psychologists assist attorneys by developing strategies for selecting and working with juries .',\n",
       " 'indeed , the area of psychological trial consulting and scientific jury selection has grown significantly over the past two decades .',\n",
       " 'psychologists can assist attorneys by helping them conceptualize their case in a way that will be most compelling for the jury .',\n",
       " 'trial consultants argue that , because attorneys develop specialized legal knowledge , they may not be able to conceptualize cases or present them in a way that will be best understood by the jury .',\n",
       " 'research shows that jurors use a socalled story model to assist them to make sense of the facts presented at trial .',\n",
       " 'according to this model , after hearing the evidence at trial and being provided the legal instructions by the judge at the end of the trial , jurors attempt to find the best match between the arguments made by the competing attorneys and the verdict options .',\n",
       " 'relying on general decisionmaking research and surveys or questionnaires that may be developed for the case at hand , psychologists can assist attorneys by helping them understand how jurors may make sense of and consider the evidence and crafting their arguments accordingly .',\n",
       " 'more recently , psychologists acting as trial consultants have begun to assist attorneys in presenting the information to the jury using modern technology to maximize the effectiveness of their arguments .',\n",
       " 'in addition to challenges for cause , attorneys may challenge a designated number of prospective jurors in each case without providing a justification .',\n",
       " 'with peremptory challenges , prospective jurors may be excluded without a reason stated , without inquiry , and without being subject to the court control .',\n",
       " 'based on the results of the surveys , psychologists can help identify the characteristics of people who would be more or less likely to make a decision in favor of their client .',\n",
       " 'then , during voir dire , potential jurors would be asked a series of questions designed to identify sympathetic and unsympathetic jurors .',\n",
       " 'the complexity and sophistication of mock juries can vary from providing the participants with a summary of information about the case to actually having attorneys present their arguments in a mock trial format .',\n",
       " 'finally , during the course of the trial , jury consultants sometimes employ shadow jurors who sit in the courtroom throughout the trial , listen to the arguments and evidence , and provide the consultant with their perceptions and opinions as the trial proceeds .',\n",
       " 'the attorneys then use this information to shape their subsequent presentations and strategies .',\n",
       " 'assisting litigants and others .',\n",
       " 'with respect to assisting litigants and others in the legal system , psychologists act in quasijudicial capacities and also provide therapeutic services .',\n",
       " 'quasijudicial roles .',\n",
       " 'over the past quarter of a century , psychologists have become increasingly involved in a number of activities in which they serve as decision makers for persons involved in the legal process .',\n",
       " 'psychologists involvement in such activities is presumably predicated upon assumptions that their interpersonal skills provide them with abilities that will facilitate examination and settling of disputes .',\n",
       " 'a number of these activities are presented next .',\n",
       " 'mediation .',\n",
       " 'in some jurisdictions , psychologists can serve as legally recognized mediators , in which they function in a quasijudicial role .',\n",
       " 'mediation is a dispute resolution process that helps persons involved in legal disputes avoid the adversarial process and courtroom litigation .',\n",
       " 'although there is considerable variability across jurisdictions and contexts , mediation at the most general level involves a neutral person who works with parties to a dispute in order to craft an agreement that is acceptable to them , with the understanding that a return to traditional litigation channels will occur if such an agreement can not be reached .',\n",
       " 'unlike many if not most litigants , parents in custody disputes must have continued contact with each other involving matters of their minor children after the court hearing their dispute has rendered a judgment .',\n",
       " 'thus , mediation proponents argue that it can be of particular value in divorce and custody proceedings because of its potential to diminish some of the acrimony and emotion that is associated with the adversarial process .',\n",
       " 'proponents of using mediation in cases of contested custody argue that it has the potential to facilitate settlement of a large number of cases headed for court , speed litigation times , decrease litigation costs , increase compliance with custody agreements , and improve family relationships , including the relationship that the divorcing or separating parents have with each other and their children .',\n",
       " 'some , however , have questioned the value of mediation in matters of divorce and custody .',\n",
       " 'in two thousand and five , the afcc an interdisciplinary organization of attorneys , mental health professionals , social service professionals , and accountants published the model standards of practice for family and divorce mediation , which serve as a guide for the conduct of family mediators , educate service recipients about the mediation process and what to expect , and promote public confidence in mediation as a family dispute resolution process .',\n",
       " 'is designed to help parents implement and comply with court orders or parenting plans , to make timely decisions in a manner consistent with children developmental and psychological needs , to reduce the amount of damaging conflict between caretaking adults to which children are exposed , and to diminish the pattern of unnecessary relitigation about child related issues .',\n",
       " 'parent coordinators generally have responsibility for resolving ongoing and day-to-day disputes that may develop , while the court retains the right to rule on more significant matters .',\n",
       " 'all commentators agree that serving as a parent coordinator is particularly challenging , given the level of conflict that is inherent to all cases , the hybrid role that is assumed by the professional , and the myriad regulatory and professional bodies that might consider the work of the professional .',\n",
       " 'in two thousand and five , the afcc published the guidelines for parenting coordination , the purpose of which is to provide direction to professionals , jurisdictions , and educational institutions regarding appropriate parent coordinator practice ; the parent coordinator ethical obligations ; and educational , training and experience qualifications for parent coordinators .',\n",
       " 'similarly , in two thousand and twelve , the apa published the guidelines for the practice of parenting coordination , the purpose of which is to describe best practices for ethical and competent functioning in this unique role .',\n",

       " 'accordingly , it is important that greater attention be paid to evidence based approaches that aim to assist victims of crime .',\n",

       " 'using these principles , rates of reoffending can be reduced by as much as thirty percent across different types of offenders .',\n",
       " 'not surprisingly , a voluminous literature examines this issue , most of which has been produced by experimental and social psychologists .',\n",
       " 'similarly , factors associated with increased suggestiblilty of child witnesses and strategies that can be employed to increase accuracy of their accounts are of great import to the legal system .',\n",
       " 'in response , research psychologists have made great contributions in this area as well .',\n",
       " 'a great deal of research literature has been compiled by clinical and experimental psychologists examining the causes , correlates , manifestations , assessment , and treatment of psychopathy .',\n",

       " 'in an attempt to identify the causes of violent behavior , a psychologist might investigate its emotional , behavioral , and cognitive correlates and the efficacy of various treatments and interventions .',\n",
       " 'alternatively , psychologists might conduct research examining the accuracy of a test or tool that has been designed to inform mental health professionals judgments about such risk .',\n",
       " 'in both cases , the psychologist is conducting research relevant to an important issue of concern to courts : competence to stand trial or violence risk assessment and intervention.there is no uniform or consensual definition of forensic psychology , and it is clear that psychologists make contributions to the legal system in a multitude of ways .',\n",
       " 'hugo munsterberg , the first and perhaps most ardent proponent of what psychology had to offer the legal system , recognized this more than a century ago .',\n",

       " 'the reason that forensic psychology , as a field , is broad and diverse is that it reflects the breadth and diversity of the law .',\n",

       " 'these functional abilities must be relevant to the legal question and causally related to a clinical disorder .',\n",

       " 'constitutional law does not change unless a constitution is amended , which is a fairly rare occurrence , so determining whether you have good law is most relevant when it comes to statutory law and case law .',\n",
       " 'with respect to statutes , a statute is good law unless it has been repealed or superseded by a new statute or declared unconstitutional by the court .',\n",
       " 'a classic example of a statute being declared unconstitutional is the us supreme court decision in dred scott sandford , in which the supreme court declared a recent act of congress to be unconstitutional .',\n",
       " 'in this regrettable decision , the supreme court concluded that african americans brought into the united states and held as slaves were not , in fact , citizens of the united states and therefore not entitled to protection under the us constitution .',\n",
       " 'to determine whether a statute has been repealed or superseded by a newer statute , a good starting point is determining when the statutory code was most recently updated .',\n",
       " 'then it is important to check which statutes have been updated or enacted since that update .',\n",
       " 'this information is located in what is called the pocket part of the code .',\n",
       " 'essentially , because statutes change regularly and reprinting codes is expensive , many legal references are purchased as part of a subscription .',\n",
       " 'as with statutory law , case law can become bad law when a new statute supersedes the case law or a new case replaces the old legal rule .',\n",
       " 'however , evaluating whether a case is still good law is a bit more complicated than for a statute .',\n",
       " 'as such , it is necessary to discuss some new terminology .',\n",
       " 'a case is not good law if it has been reversed or overruled or if the statute on which it was based has been updated .',\n",
       " 'the term reversed means that a higher court reviewed the specific case and disagreed with the lower court , reversing the lower court decision .',\n",
       " 'overruled means that another case occurred at a later date but involved the same legal issue , and the court decided the issue differently than it had previously .',\n",
       " 'a classic example is the brown board of education desegregation decision , which overturned the separate but equal doctrine upheld in plessy fergusson .',\n",
       " 'for example , if the results of legal research yield a trial court case but later research reveals that the case was ultimately reviewed by the us supreme court , in almost all situations the supreme court case would be cited .',\n",
       " 'this illustrates that checking the validity of a case is useful not just to make sure something is good legal authority but also to make sure that the highest legal authority for a given legal issue has been identified .',\n",
       " 'after investigating a case procedural history , it is necessary to determine whether any statutes have been enacted that have changed the case from good law to bad law .',\n",
       " 'this is a bit more arduous but basically involves reading the case and looking for any statutes the court references in the opinion .',\n",
       " 'if the court does cite one or more statutes , then it must be determined whether that statute was related to a legal issue in the case .',\n",
       " 'if the statute was related to a legal issue in the case or if the case turned on how the court interpreted the statute , it is necessary to see whether that statute has been updated .',\n",
       " 'if the statute has been updated , it becomes necessary to interpret the change in light of the case , synthesizing the literature that has been amassed .',\n",
       " 'only at that point is it possible to determine whether the case is good law or has been overruled by the statute .',\n",
       " 'one complication has to do with the degree to which someone is relying on a given legal authority .',\n",
       " 'thus , if a court higher than the one that decided a particular case has reversed or overruled the decision , then the case at hand is bad law .',\n",
       " 'if , however , a court in another jurisdiction has simply declined to adopt the approach taken by the case at hand , then the case is still good law , although there is now persuasive authority against the case .',\n",
       " 'a judge wishing to do otherwise might try to distinguish the facts of the case at hand',\n",
       " 'so the argument can be made that he or she is not answering the same legal question differently but rather answering a related but slightly different question .',\n",
       " 'having found , digested , and ascertained the validity of the relevant statutes and cases , the final step involves synthesizing the authorities .',\n",
       " 'synthesizing may sound easy at first ; after all , is it not simply putting together all of the information into a list of holdings ?',\n",
       " 'sometimes synthesis is this simple , and by bringing together all of the relevant holdings and statutes on a legal issue , it is possible to infer the legal rules the courts will likely follow when addressing a given legal issue .',\n",
       " 'however , it is not unusual to find multiple authorities that may seem to contradict one another .',\n",
       " 'based on the previous discussion about determining whether something is good law , the obvious answer in such a situation would be that something is bad law .',\n",
       " 'but what if nothing has been overruled , superseded , or revised ?',\n",
       " 'in such a situation , a series of questions may alleviate the confusion .',\n",
       " 'first , are the cases and statutes in the same jurisdiction ?',\n",
       " 'second , is everything still good law ?',\n",
       " 'if the answer to both of those questions is yes , then the most likely explanation is that there is some minor distinction between the cases or statutes .',\n",

       " 'thus , synthesizing can sometimes feel more like reconciling , but the importance of this step can not be overstated .',\n",
       " 'after all , if all of the research is not correctly synthesized , resulting in some mistake of law , much of the research process will have been for naught .',\n",

       " 'having been penalized in these ways can prevent practitioners from securing liability insurance , being listed in directories and on insurance reimbursement panels , and , most critically for forensic psychologists , having credibility as an expert witness whose integrity will not be impugned in the courtroom .',\n",
       " 'along with being potential sources of penalties when violated , ethics codes and the committees and boards that enforce them can provide support when practicing psychologists confront problematic expectations or unreasonable demands .',\n",

       " 'sensible practice and case law do not preclude attorneys calling a psychotherapist as a fact witness .',\n",

       " 'nevertheless , to serve their own purposes , attorneys may press a fact witness psychotherapist for expert testimony .',\n",
       " 'the first of these concerns the obligation of practitioners to prevent their personal values from affecting their professional conduct .',\n",
       " 'the second aspect concerns the professional responsibility of forensic psychologists to resist expectations or demands of attorneys that , although falling within the law , run counter to psychology ethical principles and standards .',\n",

       " 'however , it is one thing for psychologists to accept a case involving issues about which they have some opinion but nevertheless strive to remain objective and neutral in their work on the case ; it is quite something else for psychologists to seek out forensic opportunities in order to promote certain causes or advance some sociopolitical agenda , in which case their neutrality and objectivity would most certainly be suspect .',\n",
       " 'as suggested by hess , experts should ask themselves several questions before committing to participate in a case in which their values might cloud their judgment : would they be using the expert role to provide objective expertise or to exercise moral advocacy ?',\n",

       " 'in addition , psychologists researching these matters have devoted considerable efforts to defining the nature of these capacities .',\n",

       " 'these assessment tasks are either descriptive or predictive .',\n",
       " 'integral to understanding the potential value and accuracy of such evaluations is research that operationalizes these psycholegal capacities and examines the utility of various techniques and instruments that are designed to assess them .',\n",
       " 'only if research findings indicating that psychologists have some special abilities in understanding these issues are psychologists justified as entering the courts as experts and the courts justified in hearing psychologists testimony .',\n",

       " 'most notable perhaps , in barefoot estelle , by a six vote , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a sentence of death that was based in part on the prediction of a testifying psychiatrist that the probability that the defendant would commit additional crimes of violence in prison if not executed was one hundred percent and absolute .',\n",
       " 'more recently , us supreme court justice stevens reasoned in his dissent in united states scheffer that here is no legal requirement that expert testimony must satisfy a particular degree of reliability to be admissible .',\n",
       " 'expert testimony about a defendant future dangerousness to determine his eligibility for the death penalty , even if wrong most of the time , is routinely admitted .',\n",
       " 'similarly , in kansas hendricks and kansas crane , the court voiced approval of risk assessment in the sexual predator context .',\n",
       " 'in hendricks , the supreme court determined the constitutionality of a sexually violent predator statute , permitting the postincarceration civil commitment of sex offenders .',\n",
       " 'the intent of the statute was to civilly detain people who presented a risk to public safety due to tendencies to perpetrate sexual violence .',\n",
       " 'as with other types of civil commitment , a determination of future dangerousness was required by the statute .',\n",
       " 'future dangerousness could be determined by past sexually violent behavior , such as the crime for which the individual was incarcerated , and a connection between that behavior and a mental abnormality reducing the individual control over the dangerous behavior .',\n",
       " 'recent developments concerning the admissibility of testimony about violence risk .',\n",
       " 'our own survey of state and federal cases considering the admissibility of expert testimony on risk assessment reveals that it is rarely excluded .',\n",
       " 'testimony on risk assessment can be based on clinical interviewing techniques , reliance on results from actuarial instruments , or a combination of these techniques .',\n",
       " 'moreover , little has changed in the federal courts since frye was supplanted by daubert .',\n",
       " 'when testimony is based on the results of a clinical interview alone , courts typically admit the testimony , stating that clinical interviewing techniques are generally accepted .',\n",
       " 'however , some courts have determined that reliance only on a clinical interview and failure to use actuarial instruments renders expert testimony unreliable .',\n",
       " 'when the testimony is based in part on the results of actuarial instruments , typically it is also admitted .',\n",
       " 'courts have not specifically stated that testimony based solely on the results of actuarial instruments would be excluded .',\n",
       " 'however , this has been implied by court arguments that the testimony is admissible only because combined with clinical judgment .',\n",
       " 'for example , one court stated : by this ruling , we are not concluding that actuarial risk assessment instruments are reliable per se or have our approval when used alone and not in conjunction with a full clinical evaluation .',\n",

       " 'when this distinction is made , it is reasoned that a reliability analysis does not apply to the clinical observations because they are not scientific or novel , they are based on standard psychological analysis of behavioral observations , and they are based on experience .',\n",
       " 'they reason that the instruments do not act as a source of infallible truth or scientific infallibility when combined with clinical judgment .',\n",
       " 'other courts have argued that a frye or daubert analysis must be conducted when any part of the testimony is based on the actuarial instruments because they are scientific .',\n",
       " 'these courts have largely determined that the use of actuarial instruments in risk assessment is generally accepted and reliable , and the testimony is admitted .',\n",
       " 'however , some courts continue to reason that actuarial instruments are irrelevant and speculative in demonstrating lack of propensity for future risk of violence .',\n",
       " 'other courts concluding that testimony based on actuarial instruments satisfies frye when used to predict recidivism require frye hearings when these tools are used for other purposes , such as demonstrating the existence of a mental illness .',\n",
       " 'most of these decisions have arisen from frye jurisdictions , but reasoning about these cases in daubert jurisdictions does not differ substantially .',\n",
       " 'the daubert factors are rarely applied to this type of testimony or are applied loosely .',\n",
       " 'finally , many courts decline to assess reliability for the purpose of admission decisions , reasoning that questions of reliability go to the weight , not to the admissibility , of the evidence , or have determined that frye and daubert do not apply to the legal context of the case , such as sentencing .',\n",
       " 'in addington texas , the us supreme court ruled that individuals could be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for an extended period of time only if there was clear and convincing evidence that they met a legitimate legal standard for confinement .',\n",

       " 'moreover , it should be pointed out , the us supreme court has ruled that insanity acquittees may be required to prove that they are no longer dangerous before being released from confinement .',\n",

       " 'assessment , which we cover under legal psychology , is an essential tool of the trade for psychologists , and it underlies all practice .',\n",
       " 'nonetheless , for purposes of identifying historical trends and landmarks , discussion of these four distinctive areas is warranted .',\n",
       " 'we focus on forensic psychology rather than forensic psychiatry , which has its own well documented and rich history , probably centered on the early work of isaac ray , who is considered by some the father of forensic psychiatry .',\n",
       " 'we also do not delve into the origins of the sociology of law , referred to as sociological jurisprudence , or the legal realism movement within the law itself .',\n",
       " 'this movement , born during the first third of the twentieth century , advocated a partnership between the law and the social sciences .',\n",
       " 'in addition , we emphasize the work of forensic psychologists in the united states and , to a lesser extent , oneanada , although we give due recognition to the work of european psychologists , who dominated the field prior to world war i .',\n",

       " 'when cattell conducted his informal and preliminary study , it was reasonably well established that eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable and incomplete .',\n",
       " 'most significant for the historical development of forensic psychology was the apparent fascination cattell experiment and binet work held for william stern , who had received his doctorate in psychology at the university of berlin under the tutelage of hermann ebbinghaus .',\n",
       " 'in nineteen one , stern collaborated with the criminologist liszt in an attempt to lend realism to the cattell design .',\n",

       " 'sources differ , often depending on the nature of the forum or its context .',\n",
       " 'hale suggests that the earliest testimony by a psychologist in a criminal court occurred in eighteen ninety six , when albert von schrencknotzing testified at the trial of a munich man accused of murdering three women .',\n",
       " 'the murders had received extensive and sensational press coverage in the months prior to the trial , and schrencknotzing opined that this pretrial publicity , through a process of suggestion , probably led numerous witnesses to retroactive memoryfalsification .',\n",
       " 'witnesses could not distinguish between what they had seen and what the press reported had happened .',\n",
       " 'schrencknotzing supported this opinion with social framework testimony in the form of accounts of laboratory research on memory and suggestibility .',\n",
       " 'although the accused was convicted on the basis of solid evidence , schrencknotzing direct application of the psychology of suggestion to court processes helped stimulate the interest of both german jurists and psychologists .',\n",
       " 'however , karl marbe , a psychology professor at the university of wurzburg , credited himself with the first court appearance , fifteen years later .',\n",
       " 'the first german psychological legal expert opinion was my testimony in a case of sexual assault in wurzburg in nineteen eleven , in which i had to discuss the question of the testimony of children .',\n",
       " 'in that case , several german adolescent girls had accused their teacher of sexually molesting them .',\n",
       " 'marbe persuaded the jury that the girls statements were unreliable , and the teacher was exonerated .',\n",
       " 'also in nineteen eleven , several psychologists testified in a belgian murder trial in which a man was accused of raping and killing a nineyearold girl .',\n",
       " 'two of the child playmates had apparently seen the murderer but gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts .',\n",
       " 'he found that they were inaccurate in their recall of important events .',\n",
       " 'over the objection of the prosecution , he was allowed to present the results of these experiments as well as the general research on the psychology of testimony that was available at that time .',\n",
       " 'whipple wrote that varendonck testimony elicited violent outbursts from the court authorities , but it reached the jury and induced a verdict of not guilty , whipple added that the psychology of testimony had found its way formally into the court room and saved a man life .',\n",

       " 'varendonck , it should be noted , was vehemently opposed to any use of child witnesses in the courtroom .',\n",
       " 'marbe was asked to testify as to the probable effect of alcohol both on the mental status of the engineer and the reaction time of the fireman and guard applying the brakes .',\n",
       " 'based on reaction time experiments , marbe testified that the train could not have been stopped in time to avert a disaster .',\n",
       " 'in essence , it is not difficult to find illustrations of psychologists who had impact on the nascent field of legal psychology , but ranking their contributions chronologically must be done with caution .',\n",

       " 'in nineteen four , psychologists in germany , austria , and switzerland were busy developing a lie detection test for use in criminal investigations .',\n",
       " 'the test was a word association time task in which key words were embedded in a list of innocuous words , the test was a word reaction time task in which key words were embedded in a list of innocuous words .',\n",
       " 'one of wundt not so cautious students was the german psychologist hugo munsterberg , who arrived in the united states in eighteen ninety two at the invitation of william james to direct the psychology laboratory at harvard university .',\n",
       " 'now acknowledged by many as the father of applied psychology , he believed psychological knowledge could be applied to education , industry , advertising , music , art , and , of course , law .',\n",

       " 'charles c .',\n",
       " 'moore , a wellknown attorney , referred to munsterberg work as yellow psychology and concluded that it provided nothing new or helpful to the court .',\n",
       " 'most noteworthy , the great legal commentator john henry wigmore found it necessary to assail munsterberg in a satirical and devastating law review article .',\n",
       " 'wigmore attack was prompted by the publication of munsterberg controversial bestseller on the witness stand , in which he proclaimed that the time was ripe to apply psychology to the practical needs of the legal system .',\n",
       " 'the book which was essentially a compilation of already published columns dealt with a wide spectrum of topics , ranging from witness accuracy and jury persuasion to hypnosis and lie detection .',\n",
       " 'in similar fashion , bornstein and penrod sought to resurrect the longignored work of george frederick arnold , a civil servant in the british empire who published psychology applied to legal evidence and other constructions of law in nineteen six , two years before munsterberg on the witness stand .',\n",
       " 'munsterberg has been accused of being more an opportunist than a trailblazer , however .',\n",
       " 'it is tempting to blame his brashness , his apparently despicable demeanor , and his progerman views for the tenuous and occasionally hostile initial relationship between psychology and law .',\n",
       " 'he received a law degree in nineteen eighteen and a phd in psychology in nineteen twenty one , both from harvard .',\n",
       " 'marston interests were multifaceted .',\n",
       " 'although admitted to the massachusetts bar , marston soon gave up his law practice to concentrate on psychology .',\n",
       " 'as a laboratory assistant in psychology at radcliffe college , marston had discovered a significant positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and lying , which became the basis of the modern polygraph .',\n",
       " 'however , this interest was almost exclusively on the part of lawyers , who produced such books as legal psychology , psychology for the lawyer , and law and the social sciences .',\n",
       " 'wigmore , the foremost authority on rules of evidence , paved the way for the use of test data in the courtroom .',\n",
       " 'he observed that the psychometrist introducing test evidence would stand on the same footing as the expert witness to insanity , as long as such tests are recognized as valid and feasible by the general scientific community .',\n",
       " 'as louisell noted , however , because trial court records are generally unavailable and only appellate decisions are published , the testimony of psychologists , particularly in civil cases , may have been less rare than the paucity of documentation would indicate .',\n",
       " 'we do know that psychological testimony was almost inevitably rejected in criminal cases involving the defendant mental state .',\n",
       " 'as a general rule , only medical men that is , persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine can testify as experts on the question of insanity ; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion .',\n",
       " 'the first published case in which an american psychologist qualified as an expert appears to be state driver in nineteen twenty one .',\n",
       " 'the occasion was only a partial victory for forensic psychology , however .',\n",
       " 'a west virginia trial court accepted the chief psychologist of the state bureau of juvenile research as an expert on the matter of juvenile delinquency .',\n",

       " 'perhaps even more relevant was the suspicion directed toward psychologists by both administrative and correctional staffs .',\n",
       " 'in an essay reviewing this period in the history of correctional psychology , brodsky cited examples of military psychologists being given punitive assignments or civilian psychologists being obstructed from providing meaningful treatment services to inmates in some cases even reporting for work to find themselves no longer employed , their possessions waiting for them at the prison gate .',\n",
       " 'although positions were plentiful , the turnover rate was high , primarily because psychologists often had not received adequate preparation for responding to the unique challenges of these environments .',\n",
       " 'one noteworthy innovation that was introduced in federal prisons during this era was the unit management system , which was initially conceptualized by daniel glaser and later promoted by robert levinson .',\n",
       " 'unit management divided prison populations into small groups of prisoners and staff members based on the programming needs of the former and the expertise of the latter .',\n",
       " 'a contemporary of terman , psychologist louis thurstone , was also interested in the value of intellectual testing in police screening .',\n",

       " 'the army alpha , developed by robert yerkes , thorndike , and lewis terman and adopted by the us army in nineteen seventeen, was probably the first exclusively american test of intelligence .',\n",
       " 'in the years between the two world wars , psychologists gradually became more involved in the screening of law enforcement personnel and began to incorporate personality assessment into that enterprise .',\n",
       " 'in recent years , other board certifications have emerged , such as the american board of forensic examiners .',\n",
       " 'in two thousand and one , as noted earlier , the apa voted to recognize forensic psychology as a specialty , and specialty guidelines for forensic psychologists and psychology were adopted in nineteen ninety one and two thousand and eleven , respectively .',\n",
       " 'forensic psychology has seen a rapid expansion in other parts of the globe besides north america , particularly in europe and australia .',\n",
       " 'after an uncertain beginning and some stagnation between the two world wars , forensic psychology is now well established .',\n",
       " 'despite some continuing concerns about its definition , it is importantly clinical in nature but also critically dependent on theory and research .',\n",
       " 'indeed , brigham reported that disagreement among members of apls about how broad or narrow the definition should be initially led the group to abandon a cooperative effort with the american academy of forensic psychology to jointly sponsor a petition to have apa formally recognize forensic psychology as a specialty .',\n",
       " 'in countries that use the term forensic psychology in an expansive way , those who work in the applied areas of psychology and the law typically are referred to as clinical forensic psychologists .',\n",
       " 'regardless of the differences that exist concerning the definition of forensic psychology , it is uniformly agreed that forensic psychology involves the application of psychological knowledge and expertise to the legal system .',\n",
       " 'law relies on the adversarial method , whereas psychology relies on the experimental method .',\n",
       " 'the law seeks justice , which equates to procedural fairness .',\n",

       " 'law is idiographic , whereas psychology is nomothetic .',\n",
       " 'law operates on a case by case basis , with each case decided on the basis of its specific facts .',\n",
       " 'in contrast , psychology is interested in uncovering the general principles , relationships , and patterns that govern human behavior .',\n",
       " 'the focus in psychology is not on a particular instance but rather on what transcends the particular instance .',\n",
       " 'law is reactive , whereas psychology is proactive .',\n",
       " 'the issues that arise in the law originate from outside the system , namely , cases are brought to the attention of lawyers .',\n",

       " 'law is an applied discipline , and it is designed to deal with real world problems .',\n",
       " 'the players within the system have clearly defined roles that prescribe the issues on which they will concentrate .',\n",

       " 'with these eight tensions in mind , included in what follows is an expansive survey of what can be characterized as forensic psychology .',\n",
       " 'psychologists involvement in these matters is predicated on the assumption that their observations and opinions will educate the recipient about some psychological phenomena that are relevant to the legal matters in dispute , and , as a result , a more accurate and presumably better decision will be made .',\n",
       " 'conducting and testifying about forensic psychological evaluations .',\n",
       " 'most frequently , psychologists provide assistance to the legal system by offering observations and opinions about the emotional , behavioral , and cognitive functioning of someone whose mental state is at issue in a legal proceeding .',\n",
       " 'because a defendant , litigant , or other person emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning can be at issue in a variety of legal proceedings',\n",
       " ', psychologists find themselves evaluating and testifying about the functioning of persons in many different legal matters .',\n",
       " 'in criminal proceedings , psychologists may evaluate defendants when there are questions about their competence to proceed , criminal responsibility , and treatment needs for consideration at the time of sentencing .',\n",
       " 'in civil proceedings , psychologists can evaluate litigants and others when there are questions about their capacity to parent , manage their personal and financial affairs , execute a will , work , or make healthcare decisions , or when there are disputes about their emotional , behavioral , or cognitive functioning as it relates to their risk for harming themselves or others or an alleged wrong committed by a third party .',\n",
       " 'in these cases , such as recent legal disputes regarding the apple and samsung wireless phones , one company alleges that another is unfairly encroaching on a unique aspect of its product that results in consumer confusion and harms the company economically .',\n",
       " 'in zippo manufacturing rogers imports , the zippo lighter company argued that a competitor rogers imports copied the design of its cigarette lighter in such a way that it violated its trademark , caused consumers to confuse the two brands , and resulted in decreased zippo sales and income .',\n",
       " 'psychologists can also assist legal decision makers and legislative bodies by providing observations and expert opinions about more general matters that are nonetheless of interest to the court or legislature .',\n",
       " 'walker and monahan referred to this as social authority testimony .',\n",
       " 'in litigation contexts , psychologists typically testify about research that sheds light on some matter or an assumption that is relevant to the case at hand , but they typically do not offer opinions about specific case matters .',\n",
       " 'thus , a psychologist knowledgeable about limitations in how adolescents understand and exercise their constitutional rights while in custody might testify before a legislative body that is considering a law mandating that minors be appointed counsel in delinquency proceedings , whereas a psychologist knowledgeable about the relationship between watching violence on television and aggressive behavior of children might offer expert testimony to a body considering legislation limiting what is broadcast on television during daytime hours .',\n",
       " 'finally , in a very different line of research , kovera and her colleagues examined the impact of expert testimony on the legal decision making of judges and jurors .',\n",
       " 'as the information just presented demonstrates , the roles of forensic psychologists in these contexts can be broad and varied .',\n",
       " 'at a micro level , their work can involve conducting and reporting the results of psychological assessments or conducting case specific research , both with the intent of providing case relevant knowledge to the legal decision maker that it would not otherwise have , so that more informed and better decisions are made .',\n",
       " 'at the other end of the spectrum the macro level psychologists can help policy makers , legislators , and decision makers better understand the need for or potential impact of proposed legislation or the legal system and its operation .',\n",
       " 'when empaneling a jury , attorneys may rely on forensic psychologists to assist them in selecting the most desirable jurors and deselecting the least desirable jurors .',\n",
       " 'typically , psychologists survey members of the community about matters pertaining to a case in order to identify those characteristics that relate attitudes about the case and case outcomes .',\n",
       " 'consultants may also use focus groups to obtain additional information about the views of people regarding matters at issue in the particular case and how prospective jurors may respond to different arguments .',\n",
       " 'research shows that , without assistance , attorneys may not be very skilled at identifying jurors who might be biased against their clients .',\n",
       " 'although the empirical evidence shows an increased likelihood that jurors will find in favor of the side that employs jury consultants , the results vary across studies and in actual cases particularly since both sides may use consultants .',\n",
       " 'in addition to the strategies just outlined , psychologists who work as jury consultants sometimes employ mock or shadow juries .',\n",
       " 'parent coordination .',\n",
       " 'over the past fifteen to twenty years , psychologists and other mental health professionals have taken on a new role in family court proceedings of parent coordinator or special master .',\n",
       " 'according to the apa , parent coordination is a nonadversarial dispute resolution process that is court ordered or agreed on by divorced and separated parents who have an ongoing pattern of high conflict and litigation about their children .',\n",
       " 'the goal of these evaluations is to facilitate better informed legal decision making by a court or to assist attorneys in their representation of a client .',\n",
       " 'in contrast to general clinical assessments in which the referral question is necessarily clinical in nature , the referral question in fmhas is guided by a specific legal issue defined by a law within the jurisdiction in which the assessment occurs .',\n",
       " 'moreover , a large portion of the questions on the written examination for board certification in forensic psychology by the american board of forensic psychology assess clinicians knowledge of laws , precedents , court rules , civil procedures , criminal procedures , and judicial practices .',\n",
       " 'similarly , board certification for forensic psychiatrists includes , among other requirements , passing an examination that focuses on criminal law , civil law , legal regulation of psychiatry , and other legal topics .',\n",
       " 'in this chapter , we present an overview of conducting legal research , with a specific eye toward mental health professionals who do not have any formal legal training .',\n",
       " 'we begin by discussing the importance of understanding the law , particularly for those mental health professionals who conduct fmhas .',\n",
       " 'because law is established through multiple sources in the united states , acquiring legal knowledge can be a complicated , tedious , and admittedly intimidating process .',\n",
       " 'fortunately , finding and understanding the law may be accomplished in a variety of formal and informal ways .',\n",
       " 'in addition to examining primary and secondary sources of law such as case law , statutes , administrative codes , and a variety of legally relevant publications it is possible to gain proficiency with legal issues through discussions with attorneys and consultation with colleagues and by staying abreast of the relevant behavioral science literature .',\n",
       " 'from that law flows the questions that will be addressed by the mental health expert .',\n",
       " 'however , because legal definitions are not tantamount to psychological concepts , an important element in conducting an fmha entails translating legal language about functional capacities and behavior into relevant measurable constructs .',\n",
       " 'for example , no equivalent solitary constructs exist in the mental health sciences for legal terms such as knowing , intelligent , and voluntary .',\n",
       " 'experts conducting fmhas must therefore operationalize these legal concepts in a way that permits them to be meaningfully measured .',\n",
       " 'however , in the majority of forensic evaluation contexts , no brightline rule applies , and the evaluator must devise a more complex methodology that incorporates relevant legal questions , an examination of the evaluee underlying psychopathology , and an assessment of the evaluee relevant functional legal capacities .',\n",
       " 'a forensic mental health professional who knows relevant laws and who can identify the forensic issues is in a good position to focus an fmha on specific content domains .',\n",
       " 'for example , by specifying the forensic issues and relevant functional abilities , a forensic mental health professional can narrow the scope of an evaluation by asking questions and administering tests that yield data directly relevant to the legal issue .',\n",
       " 'clinical assessment instruments that address constructs relevant to criminal and civil cases may also be used in the evaluation .',\n",
       " 'the forensic mental health professional must also strive to ensure that his or her testimony will likely be deemed admissible in court under applicable evidentiary standards .',\n",
       " 'the frye general acceptance standard states that for scientific evidence to be admissible in court , the procedure from which the evidence is deduced must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance within the relevant scientific community ; of note , it is the procedures used to obtain the scientific evidence , not the evidence itself , that must be generally accepted .',\n",
       " 'with respect to forming opinions , some jurisdictions prohibit testimony on the ultimate legal issue , reserving this role exclusively for the legal decision maker .',\n",
       " 'for example , although testimony on the ultimate legal issue is permitted under the fre , expert witnesses in federal criminal trials are not permitted to state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or an element of a defense to the crime .',\n",
       " 'because jurisdictional rules regarding ultimate issue testimony may differ , it is crucial that forensic mental health professionals are well versed in the laws of the jurisdiction',\n",
       " 'so they avoid overstepping their boundaries .',\n",
       " 'as previously described , some degree of legal knowledge is a necessary precursor to devising and conducting a highquality fmha .',\n",
       " 'lacking a sufficient understanding of pertinent laws may preclude a forensic clinician from identifying the relevant forensic issues and functional legal capacities in a particular case .',\n",
       " 'clinicians who do not possess adequate legal knowledge may present findings that are irrelevant to the legal question .',\n",
       " 'some scholars have argued that providing ultimate issue testimony is not problematic because many judges and attorneys request forensic clinicians opinions on the ultimate legal question , whereas others counsel against answering the ultimate legal question because it represents an inappropriate intrusion into the domain of the legal fact finder .',\n",
       " 'these scholars argue that because an opinion on an ultimate legal issue can not be rendered without consideration of morals and values , experts conducting fmhas should not stray from their role in offering psychological testimony and opinions related to clinical condition , functional legal capacities , and the relation between the two .',\n",
       " 'for this and other reasons , looking up the law sometimes can be a surprisingly convoluted process .',\n",
       " 'it is not uncommon for novice researchers or those without formal legal training to struggle when first conducting legal research .',\n",
       " 'fortunately , as any first year law student would likely attest , there is a profound learning curve when it comes to conducting legal research .',\n",
       " 'as with the overarching governmental structures , a separation of powers also exists among the three branches of the government .',\n",
       " 'put simply , the legislative branch creates statutes , the judicial branch interprets those statutes via case law , and the executive branch creates administrative agencies that carry out the law and enact regulations .',\n",
       " 'the law created by the executive branch , which is often in the form of an executive order issued by the president or a state governor , is of limited utility to forensic mental health professionals , so here we focus primarily on statutes , case law , and constitutional law .',\n",
       " 'case law .',\n",
       " 'after a statute is enacted , the courts are responsible for interpreting and applying that statutory law in the context of specific disputes , which means that courts are also a source of law .',\n",
       " 'in the process of applying the law , the courts determine where and when the statute applies , whether there are any exceptions to its application , and how vague statutory language should be interpreted .',\n",
       " 'if a court goes so far as to declare a statute invalid , then the statute must be revised by the legislature before it can legally be applied .',\n",
       " 'assuming , however , that the statute is not invalidated , courts will apply the statute in the context of legal disputes .',\n",
       " 'in that sense , constitutions largely protect individuals by limiting governmental power .',\n",
       " 'many state constitutions closely parallel the us constitution , but that pattern is more convention or convenience than requirement .',\n",
       " 'thus , secondary sources may include books purchased at a local bookstore , internet articles or forums discussing a topic of law , or even video or audio recordings .',\n",
       " 'speaking more narrowly , though , there are a few specific secondary legal sources to which legal researchers often turn .',\n",
       " 'legal dictionaries provide the meaning and typical use of legal terms and phrases .',\n",
       " 'an individual who must investigate an unfamiliar area of law might begin with a secondary source to get a broad overview of the law , which will provide insight as to how he or she should go about researching primary source material .',\n",
       " 'someone who feels confident in his or her primary source research may turn later to secondary sources of law as a final step to ensure that nothing has been overlooked .',\n",
       " 'of course , there is no reason why the two sources of law can not be used simultaneously .',\n",
       " 'having reviewed primary and secondary sources of law , an important note is worth highlighting for the forensic mental health professional .',\n",
       " 'because a crime is viewed as an offense against society , the state or federal prosecutor is responsible for bringing charges against a defendant , and he or she reserves the right to drop or amend those charges ; there are no private prosecutions in the united states .',\n",
