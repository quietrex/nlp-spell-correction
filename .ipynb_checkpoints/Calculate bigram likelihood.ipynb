    "# complete_tex = \"COMPETENCY to stand trial is a concept of jurisprudence allowing the postponement of criminal proceedings for those defendants who are unable to participate in their defense on account of mental disease or intellectual disability. Because trial competency issues are raised substantially more often than the insanity defense, psychologists involved in forensic assessment and consultation are likely to have more experience with competency evaluations than those of criminal responsibility. Provisions allowing for a delay of trial because a defendant was incompetent to proceed have long been a part of the judicial system due process standards. English common law allowed for an arraignment, trial, judgment, or execution of an alleged capital offender to be stayed if he or she. Widespread use of screening instruments would serve to lower these costs, because the majority of individuals for whom competence is clearly not an issue would be screened out. Only those defendants whom the screening instrument has identified as potentially incompetent would then be referred for a more indepth assessment. Laws regarding competency vary from state to state, although most jurisdictions follow procedures similar to the overview we describe in this section. Clinicians should consult the statute for the specific law and procedures applicable in their state. The Jackson decision led to revisions in state statutes that provided alternatives to commitment and limited the length of commitment. The duration of confinement varies from state to state; some states have specific time limits while others are based on a proportion of the length of sentence that would have been given if the defendant were convicted.\"\n",
